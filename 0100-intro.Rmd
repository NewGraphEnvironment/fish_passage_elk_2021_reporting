Nupqu Limited Partnership was retained by the Canadian Wildlife Federation in the summer of 2021 to conduct fish passage and habitat confirmation assessments at road-stream crossings as part of connectivity restoration planning targeting westslope cutthrout trout within the Elk River watershed group. New Graph Environment Ltd. was sub-contracted by Nupqu Limited Partnership to assist with project delivery. The assessments build on work completed in 2020 which included 72 fish passage assessments and 15 habitat confirmation assessments in the Elk River watershed group [@irvine2021UpperElk].

The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat [@Bramblett_2002; @swalesRoleOffChannelPonds1989; @diebel_etal2015EffectsRoad].  Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to low water depth, increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues [@slaneyFishHabitatRehabilitation1997; @cote_etal2005Fishpassage]. As road crossing structures are commonly upgraded or removed there are numerous opportunities to restore connectivity by ensuring that fish passage considerations are incorporated into repair, replacement, relocation and deactivation designs.
