Although remediation and replacement of stream crossing structures can have benefits to local fish populations [@saldicaromileStreamHabitatRestoration2004; @roni_etal2008GlobalReview], the costs of remedial works can be significant and the impacts of the work often complex to evaluate and quantify.  Additionally, allocation of ecosystem restoration funding towards infrastructure upgrades on transportation right of ways are not always considered ethical under all circumstances from all perspectives.  When funds are finite and invested groups are engaged in fund raising, cost benefits and the ethics of crossing replacements should be explored collaboratively alongside the cost benefits and ethics of alternative investment activities including transportation corridor relocation/deactivation, land procurement/covenant, cattle exclusion, riparian restoration, habitat complexing, water conservation, commercial/recreational fishing management, salt water interventions and research.
