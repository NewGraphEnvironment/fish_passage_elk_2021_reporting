# Recommendations

Although remediation and replacement of stream crossing structures can have benefits to local fish populations [@saldicaromileStreamHabitatRestoration2004; @roni_etal2008GlobalReview], the costs of remedial works can be significant and the impacts of the work on fisheries communities often complex to evaluate and quantify.  The potential cost benefits, ethical dynamics and feasibility of ecosystem restoration funding allocation towards infrastructure upgrades on transportation right of ways should be explored collaboratively alongside the cost benefits, ethical dynamics and feasibility of alternative/additional investment activities such as transportation corridor relocation/deactivation, land procurement/covenant, cattle exclusion, riparian restoration, habitat complexing, water conservation, commercial/recreational fishing management and research.
