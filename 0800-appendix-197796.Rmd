## Site Location {-}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on a `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_name)` 30km south-east Fernie on an unnamed spur road.  The site was located within the Wigwam Flats - Mt. Broadwood/Sportsmans Ridge access management area with a locked gate to prevent entry by motorized vehicles [@geobc2021MapWigwam].  The access gate is located approximately 3km up from the junction of the Lodgepole FSR and the Wigwam FSR. The culvert was located `r round(my_bcfishpass() %>% pull(downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream from the confluence with Lodgepole Creek. No information was available regarding road tenure.

## Background {-}


At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_name)` is a `r my_bcfishpass() %>% pull(stream_order) %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately `r fpr_wshd_par()`km^2^. The elevation of the north-west facing watershed ranges from a maximum of `r fpr_wshd_par(col = 'elev_max')`m to `r fpr_wshd_par(col = 'elev_min')`m near the crossing (Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-197796)). Upstream of the stream crossing, no fish have previously been recorded [@moe2020KnownBC; @norris2020bcfishobs].

fpr_tab_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %>%

           footnote_text = 'Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above')

```

<br>

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was earmarked for assessment by Canadian Wildlife Federation along with PSCIS site 197795 due to analysis of `bcfishpass` modelling which indicated potentially large quantities of habitat suitable for westslope cutthrout trout spawning and rearing within the greater watershed including upstream of PSCIS bridge crossing 197795 which was located `r round(my_bcfishpass(dat = bcfishpass, site = 197795) %>% pull(downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream from the confluence with Lodgepole Creek. Upstream of crossing `r my_site`, there was 0.5km of habitat modelled as less than 8% gradient (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-197796). Evidence of a recent forest fire was apparent on the west side of the valley.  A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment [`r my_bcfishpass() %>% pull(dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r my_mapsheet()`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {-}

At the time of the survey, the culvert was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment]. The pipe was extensively damaged (seperating within the centre of the road),`r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(diameter_or_span_meters)`m in diameter with a length of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(length_or_width_meters)`m, a culvert slope of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(culvert_slope_percent)`%, a stream width ratio of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_width_ratio)` and an outlet drop of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(outlet_drop_meters)`m (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-197796)).

```{r eval=F}
##this is useful to get some comments for the report
hab_site %>% filter(site == my_site & location == 'ds') %>% pull(comments)
my_priority <-  my_priority_info()

```

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {-}

The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for `r my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') %>% pull(survey_length_m)`m `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197796-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197796-02))")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197796-d01))"))`. Total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'ds') %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(v)` with  `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'ds') %>% filter(v == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` dominant. Cover was also present as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'ds') %>% filter(v == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` (Table \@ref(tab:tab-habitat-summary-197796)). The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = 'avg channel width m')`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = 'average gradient percent')`%. The dominant substrate was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = "bed material dominant")` with `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = "bed material subdominant")` subdominant.  There steep sections to ~15% with steps to 1.8m in height created by large woody debris and bedrock throughout the area surveyed.  The habitat was rated as `r my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') %>%  pull(hab_value)` value for resident salmonid rearing due primarily to the steep grades. 

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {-}

The stream was surveyed immediately upstream from `r as.character(my_site)` for approximately `r my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% pull(survey_length_m)`m to a 2.4m high rock falls that represents a permanent barrier to upstream fish passage in the watershed  `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197796-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197796-04))")} else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197796-d02))"))`. Within the area surveyed, total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us') %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(v)` with  `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us') %>% filter(v == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` dominant. Cover was also present as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us') %>% filter(v == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` (Table \@ref(tab:tab-habitat-summary-197796)). The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = 'avg channel width m')`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = 'avg wetted width m')`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = 'average gradient percent')`%.  The dominant substrate was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = "bed material dominant")` with `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = "bed material subdominant")` subdominant. Habitat value was rated as `r my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% pull(hab_value)` value resident salmonid rearing and spawning due to the small amount of habitat available.

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {-}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed at the site, replacement of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge (`r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at \$`r format(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_est_1000s) * 1000, big.mark = ',')` for a cost benefit of `r as.character(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_net))` linear m/\$1000 and `r as.character(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_area_net))`m^2^/\$1000. 


<br>


## Conclusion {-}

There was `r as.character(my_site)` is `r my_priority_info() %>% pull(upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of habitat upstream of crossing rated as `r my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us') %>% pull(hab_value)` value for salmonid rearing and spawning. The road is within the Wigwam Flats - Mt. Broadwood/Sportsmans Ridge access management area and no information was available regarding road tenure. Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was observed to have extensive damage within the structure and was ranked as a `r my_priority_info() %>% pull(priority)` priority for proceeding to design for replacement. The site could also be considered for removal and road deactivation once silviculture obligations have been met in the area.
