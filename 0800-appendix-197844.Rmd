## Site Location {-}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on a `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_name)` 2.5km west of Fernie on `r my_overview_info() %>% pull(road_name)`.  The crossing is located within the Mount Fernie Provincial Park Boundary and approximately 75m  upstream from the confluence with Lizard Creek and the responsibility of the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. The area is a popular recreational destination for hikers and mountain bikers.


<br>

## Background {-}


At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_name)` is a `r my_bcfishpass() %>% pull(stream_order) %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately `r fpr_wshd_par()`km^2^. The elevation of the east facing watershed ranges from a maximum of `r fpr_wshd_par(col = 'elev_max')`m to `r fpr_wshd_par(col = 'elev_site')`m at the crossing (Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-197844)). Upstream of `r my_overview_info() %>% pull(road_name)`, no fish have previously been recorded [@moe2020KnownBC]. Downstream, Bighorn Creek supports westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout and mountain whitefish [@moe2020KnownBC].  Bighorn Creek has been noted as contributing significantly to habitat suitable for bull trout spawning in the Wigwam River system with spawning been noted just upstream of the confluence with the Wigwam River.  The Wigwam River has been characterized as the most important spawning system in the East Kootenay region, supporting some of the largest westslope cutthrout trout in the Kootenay Region and is located ~11.5km downstream of the subject culvert [@strong_k_d_2015McNeilSubstrate; @cope_morris2001WigwamRiver].  @strong_k_d_2015McNeilSubstrate report that substrate core samples have been taken within Bighorn Creek at an index site ~700m upstream of the confluence with the Wigwam River between 2003 - 2008 and again in 2015 with an objective of analyzing stream substrate material/sediment levels to produce trend data valuable in monitoring suitability of stream reaches identified as critical for bull trout spawning.

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was surveyed with a phase 1 assessment opportunistically during field assessments in the area and was prioritized for follow up with a habitat confirmation as it was considered the crossing with the highest potential for remediation located within the Bighorn Creek watershed area.  The site was noted as having a significantly sized outlet drop and good flow with a location very close to the mainstem of Bighorn Creek which contains confirmed spawning habitat for westslope cutthrout trout. Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-197787) `r text_ref_tab_summary_bcfp()`.  Additionally, 0.6km of habitat <8% gradient was modelled as located upstream. A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment [`r my_bcfishpass() %>% pull(dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r my_mapsheet()`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {-}

At the time of the survey, the culvert under `r my_overview_info() %>% pull(road_name)` was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment]. The pipe was `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(diameter_or_span_meters)`m in diameter with lengths of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(length_or_width_meters)`m, a culvert slope of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(culvert_slope_percent)`%, a stream width ratio of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_width_ratio)` and an outlet drop of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(outlet_drop_meters)`m (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-197844)). Water temperature was `r my_habitat_info(sit = my_site) %>% filter(rowname == 'temperature c') %>% pull(us)`$^\circ$C, pH was `r my_habitat_info(sit = my_site) %>% filter(rowname == 'p h') %>% pull(us)` and conductivity was `r my_habitat_info(sit = my_site) %>% filter(rowname == 'conductivity m s cm') %>% pull(us)`uS/cm. 


<br>

```{r eval=F}
##this is useful to get some comments for the report
hab_site %>% filter(site == my_site & location == 'us') %>% pull(comments)
my_priority <-  my_priority_info()

```

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {-}

The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for `r my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') %>% pull(survey_length_m)`m to the confluence with Bighorn Creek `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197844-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197844-02))")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197844-d01))"))`. Total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'ds') %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(v)` with  `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'ds') %>% filter(v == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` dominant. Cover was also present as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'ds') %>% filter(v == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` (Table \@ref(tab:tab-habitat-summary-197844)). The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = 'avg channel width m')`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = 'average gradient percent')`%. The dominant substrate was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = "bed material dominant")` with `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = "bed material subdominant")` subdominant. The stream was noted as going subsurface at ~40m downstream of the road then rewatering at ~80m downstream.  There was evidence of high velocity/volume flows with a general lack of complexity. The habitat was rated as `r my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') %>%  pull(hab_value)` value for salmonid rearing and spawning due to dewatering, as well as a lack of deep pool and undercut bank cover.

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {-}

The stream was surveyed  upstream from `r as.character(my_site)` for approximately `r my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% pull(survey_length_m)`m to the location of a 1.1m high rock that likely presents a barrier to upstream fish passage `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197844-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197844-04))")} else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197844-d2))"))`. A ford (PSCIS 197801) was located on a spur road located upstream approximately 220m upstream of the FSR. Within the area surveyed, total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us') %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(v)` with  `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us') %>% filter(v == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` dominant. Cover was also present as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us') %>% filter(v == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` (Table \@ref(tab:tab-habitat-summary-197844)). The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = 'avg channel width m')`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = 'avg wetted width m')`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = 'average gradient percent')`%.  The dominant substrate was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = "bed material dominant")` with `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = "bed material subdominant")` subdominant. Occasional pools suitable for juvenile westslope cutthroat trout overwintering and frequent pockets of gravel present suitable for spawning were noted throughout. The fairly steep system had good flow with intermittent small woody debris drops between 0.5 and 1m in height. Habitat value was rated as `r my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% pull(hab_value)`  with moderate potential for juvenile salmonid rearing.

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {-}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed at the site, replacement of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge (`r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at \$`r format(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_est_1000s) * 1000, big.mark = ',')` for a cost benefit of `r as.character(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_net))` linear m/\$1000 and `r as.character(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_area_net))`m^2^/\$1000.


<br>


## Conclusion {-}

There was `r my_priority_info() %>% pull(upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of viable juvenile rearing habitat upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`. Habitat in the areas surveyed upstream of the culvert were rated as `r my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us') %>% pull(hab_value)` value for salmonid rearing.   `r my_overview_info() %>% pull(road_name)`, at the crossing location, is located within the Mount Fernie Provincial Park Boundary and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy.  As the crossing is located approximately 75m  upstream from the confluence with Lizard Creek where westslope cutthrout trout spawning is known to occur, remediation of fish passage at the site could provide sdditional habitat for fry and juveniles migrating from the mainstem of Lizard Creek.  Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a `r my_priority_info() %>% pull(priority)` priority for proceeding to design for replacement.
