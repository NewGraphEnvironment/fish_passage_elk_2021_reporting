Modern civilization has a long journey ahead to acknowledge and address the historic and ongoing impacts of colonialism that have resulted in harm to the cultures and livelihoods of those that have lived in harmony with the land for many thousands of years. That harm extends naturally to the ecosystems themselves.

Nupqu Limited Partnership was retained by the Canadian Wildlife Federation in the fall of 2020 to plan and conduct fish passage and habitat confirmation assessments at road-stream crossings as part of connectivity restoration planning targeting westslope cutthrout trout within the Elk River watershed group. New Graph Environment Ltd. was sub-contracted by Nupqu Limited Partnership to assist with project delivery.

<br>


The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat [@Bramblett_2002; @swalesRoleOffChannelPonds1989; @diebel_etal2015EffectsRoad].  Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to low water depth, increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues [@slaneyFishHabitatRehabilitation1997; @cote_etal2005Fishpassage]. As road crossing structures are commonly upgraded or removed there are numerous opportunities to restore connectivity by ensuring that fish passage considerations are incorporated into repair, replacement, relocation and deactivation designs. 




<!--chapter:end:0100-intro.Rmd-->



# Background
As a result of high-level direction from the provincial government, a Fish Passage Strategic Approach protocol has been developed for British Columbia to ensure that the greatest opportunities for restoration of fish passage are pursued.  A Fish Passage Technical Working Group has been formed to coordinate the protocol and data is continuously amalgamated within the Provincial Steam Crossing Inventory System (PSCIS).  The strategic approach protocol involves a four-phase process as described in @fishpassagetechnicalworkinggroupFishPassageStrategic2014 :

 * Phase 1: Fish Passage Assessment – Fish stream crossings within watersheds with high fish values are assessed to determine barrier status of structures and document a general assessment of adjacent habitat quality and quantity.
 * Phase 2: Habitat Confirmation – Assessments of crossings prioritized for follow up in Phase 1 studies are conducted to confirm quality and quantity of habitat upstream and down as well as to scope for other potential nearby barriers that could affect the practicality of remediation.
 * Phase 3: Design – Site plans and designs are drawn for priority crossings where high value fish habitat has been confirmed. 
 * Phase 4: Remediation – Reconnection of isolated habitats through replacement, rehabilitation or removal of prioritized crossing structure barriers. 
 
  
<br>

The Canadian Wildlife Federation has been working on a watershed connectivity remediation plan for the Elk River watershed that incorporates the provincial Strategic Approach and local knowledge of the watershed to prioritize barriers for remediation, to restore connectivity for westslope cutthroat trout and other species in a strategic manner. Nupqu Limited Partnership was retained to conduct fish passage assessments and habitat confirmations to fill data gaps in support of this work.


## Project Location

To focus the project within habitat considered high value for conservation of westslope cutthrout trout, the study area included the upper Elk River watershed upstream of the Kookanusa Reservoir (Figure \@ref(fig:overview-map)).  

<br>

The Elk River has a mean annual discharge of `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = "08NK016")$LTMAD,1)` m^3^/s at station 08NK016 near Sparwood and `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = "08NK002")$LTMAD,1)` m^3^/s at station 08NK016 near Fernie with flow patterns typical of high elevation watersheds on the west side of the Rocky Mountains which receive large amounts of precipitation as snow leading to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July (Figures \@ref(fig:hydrology-plot) - \@ref(fig:hydrology-stats2)) [@canada2020NationalWater].

### Ktunaxa Nation

The project location is within the traditional territory of the Ktunaxa Nation [@KtunaxaNation2020] with Elk River components within an area known as Qukin ʔamakʔis, or Raven’s Land [@ministryofforests2020ElkValley]. When Europeans settled in the Kootenay Region around 200 hundred years ago, the Indian Reserves were created which lead to the seven Indian Bands:

 * ʔakisq̓nuk- Columbia Lake Band (Windermere, BC);
 * ʔaq̓am- St. Mary's Band (Cranbrook, BC);
 * ʔakink̓umǂasnuqǂiʔit- Tobacco Plains Band (Grasmere, BC);
 * yaqan nuʔkiy- Lower Kootenay Band (Creston, BC);
 * kyaknuqǂiʔit- Shuswap Band (Invermere, BC);
 * ʔaq̓anqmi- Kootenai Tribe of Idaho (Bonners Ferry, Idaho);
 * k̓upawi¢q̓nuk- Ksanka Band (Elmo, Montana)

<br>

@KtunaxaNation2020 report the vision statement of the Ktunaxa as:

<br>

"Kȼmak̓qa ksukⱡuⱡa·k kuk̓qani ȼ k̓itqakiⱡ haqa ksiʔⱡ ȼxa ʔa·kⱡukqaʔis ksukiⱡq̓ukaʔmi·k kiʔin Ktunaxa naʔs ʔamak̓ʔis. Qus pik̓aksȼ naʔs ȼxaⱡ yaqanakiⱡ haqaʔki. K̓itqawiȼmu kakiⱡwiȼkiⱡ ʔamakʔis k̓isnikȼik kȼxaⱡ qa kiⱡkk̓axuxami·k k̓itqakiⱡ haqa ȼ k̓isʔin ʔaknumuȼtiⱡʔis."

<br>

The vision statement has been translated to english as:

<br>

"Strong, healthy citizens and communities, speaking our languages and celebrating who we are and our history in our ancestral homelands, working together, managing our lands and resources, within a self-sufficient, self-governing Nation."

### Elk Valley Cumulative Effects Management Framework

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Coal deposits are located in the Elk River and Flathead coalfields which extend fromthe Canada-USA border to the northwest for 175km along the Rocky Mountains with cumulative coal thickness ranging up to 70m. Subsurface resource exploration and develpment is prohibited in the Flathead River watershed due to legislation enacted in 2011.  At the time of reporting there were four active coal mines in the Elk River watershed (Fording River, Greenhills, Line Creek and Elkview), one closed mine (Coal Mountain) as well as multiple exploration projects and proposed new mines [@ministryofenergy2020EastKootenay].

```


First Nations, stakeholders, proponents and provincial and municipal governments have recognized that the region has been impacted by historic and current coal operations as well as other stresses such as forestry operations, wildfire, residential development, recreational activities and transportation.  To assess the historic, current and potential future conditions of valued ecosystem components and to support resource management decisions within the region, the Provincial Cumulative Effects Framework and the Elk Valley Cumulative Effects Management Framework (EV-CEMF) have been formed under joint management between the Ktunaxa Nation Council and the B.C. Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development (FLNRORD). A working group consisting of the Ktunaxa Nation Council, industry, community, organizations, and provincial government ministries has been formed to provide guidance and oversight for EV-CEMF activities.  Valued component technical reports for Grizzly Bear, Riparian and westslope cutthroat trout [@davidson_etal2018AquaticEcosystems], bighorn sheep, and old and mature forest have been drafted, integrated into an overarching Cumulative Effects Assessment and Management Report [@elkvalleycumulativeeffectsmanagementframeworkworkinggroup2018ElkValley] and endorsed by the Working Group. These reports describe the historical, current, and future assessment of cumulative effects in the Elk Valley and provide management and mitigation recommendations. Next steps for the framework include the development of an Implementation Plan to identify priority actions and spatial locations to focus management and mitigation of cumulative effects in the valley which may include actions to address aquatic habitat connectivity issues [@ministryofforests2020ElkValley].

<br>

## Fisheries

Fish species recorded in the Elk River watershed group are detailed in Table \@ref(tab:fiss-species-table) [@data_fish_obs].  Bull trout and westslope cutthrout trout are considered of special concern (blue-listed) provincially and westslope cutthrout trout (Pacific populations) are are listed under the *Species at Risk Act* by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada as a species of special concern [@bcspeciesecosystemexplorer2020Salvelinusconfluentusa; @bcspeciesecosystemexplorer2020Oncorhynchusclarkii; @schweigert_etal2017COSEWICassessment].  The focus of 2020 field work was to assess potential impacts of road-stream crossings on habitat connectivity for westslope cutthrout trout.

### Westslope Cutthrout Trout

There are multiple life history strategies for westslope cutthrout trout including stream-resident, fluvial and adfluvial.  All have habitat requirements during life history stages that include cold clean water and varied forms of cover (undercut banks, pool-riffle habitat and riparian vegetation).  Stream-resident fish inhabitat headwater streams above barriers, complete their life cycle within a relatively small range and typically remain relatively small (i.e. <200mm in length).  Fluvial fish are migratory subpopulations that migrate between small spawning/rearing tributaries and larger adult rearing rivers. Lengths of fluvial fish generally reach more than 400mm.  Finally, adfluvial subpopulations  rear in lakes and migrate to spawning/rearing tributaries with lengths often exceeding 500mm [@schweigert_etal2017COSEWICassessment].


<br>

Spawning habitat for resident and fluvial subpopulations are documented as within the tailouts of deep pools at moderate to high-flow events within small, low-gradient streams with cold well-oxygenated water and clean unsilted gravels [@schmetterling2001SeasonalMovements]. Proximity to large woody debris, boulder or bedrock cover is important for spawning fish while residing in spawning tributaries as high mortality may result when suitable cover is lacking.  The dominant substrate used for spawning is gravel (1.8 - 3.3cm diameter) with spawning occurring in late May and June towards the end of the spring freshet with rising water temperatures between 7-11$^\circ$C.  Nine of 11 westslope cutthrout trout radio-tagged in the Blackfoot River drainage, Montana by @schmetterling2001SeasonalMovements made movements to tributaries presumable for spawning. While in tributaries, fish movements to spawning sites averaged 12.5km where they stayed within an approximately 100m reach during the spawning period for between 15 and 63 days.

<br>

Small perennial streams with a diversity of cover are important for juvenile rearing with young-of-year fish inhabiting low energy lateral habitats (i.e. shallow riffle or backwatered areas) with cover available.  Larger juveniles move into pools with social dominance behaviors prevalent and based on fish size.  Availability of pool habitat is important and limiting for parr which have large territories [@schweigert_etal2017COSEWICassessment; @schmetterling2001SeasonalMovements].

<br>

The suitability of overwintering habitat is determined by groundwater influx and the absence of anchor ice with fluvial adults congregating in slow deep pools in the winter.  Boulders and other large in-stream structures or off-channel habitat (beaver bonds and sloughs) provide cover for juveniles with adfluvial fish overwintering in lakes [@schweigert_etal2017COSEWICassessment; @brown_mackay1995Spawningecology; @cope_etal2017UpperFording]. 

<br>


In a swimming performance study conducted in an open-channel flume @blank_etal2020SwimmingPerformance estimated the overall average swim speeds of westlope cutthrout trout (150mm - 290mm in length) at 0.84m/s with a maximum observed swim speed of 3.55m/s. 

<br>

The greatest threats to westslope cutthrout trout are hybridization with non-native rainbow trout and degradation of the environment due to forestry, hydroelectric development, mining, urbanization and agriculture [@schweigert_etal2017COSEWICassessment]. @lamson2020EvaluationCurrent sampled over 2000 trout in the Upper Kootenay watershed from 2014 to 2019 with results of genotyping indicating consistently high levels of westslope cutthrout trout allele purity (i.e. very low levels of rainbow trout, yellowstone cutthrout trout or coastal cutthrout trout genetic introgression) throughout the Elk River watershed areas upstream of the Elko Dam. @boyer_etal2008Rainbowtrout sampled 31 sites in the upper Flathead River system within the United States (27 sites) and Canada (4 sites).  Genetic introgression declined with latitude with no evidence of rainbow trout allelles within any westslope cutthrout trout sampled within the Canadian portion of the upper Flathead River.

A summary of historical westslope cutthrout trout observations in the Elk River watershed group by average gradient category of associated stream segment is provided in Figure \@ref(fig:fish-wct-bar). Of `r wct_elkr_grad %>% filter(gradient_id == 3) %>% pull(total)` observations, `r wct_elkr_grad %>% filter(gradient_id == 3) %>% pull(Percent) + wct_elkr_grad %>% filter(gradient_id == 5) %>% pull(Percent) + wct_elkr_grad %>% filter(gradient_id == 8) %>% pull(Percent)`% were within stream segments with average gradients ranging from 0 - 8%.  A total of `r wct_elkr_grad %>% filter(gradient_id == 3) %>% pull(Percent)`% of historic observations were within stream segments with gradients between 0 - 3%, `r wct_elkr_grad %>% filter(gradient_id == 5) %>% pull(Percent)`% were within stream segments with gradients ranging from 3 - 5% and `r wct_elkr_grad %>% filter(gradient_id == 8) %>% pull(Percent)`% were within stream segments with gradients between 5 - 8% [@data_fish_obs; @norris2020bcfishobs].

# Methods

Workflows for the project have been classified into planning, fish passage assessments, habitat confirmation assessments, reporting and mapping. All components leveraged `R`, `SQL` or `Python` programming languages to facilitate workflow tracking, collaboration, transparency and continually improving research. Project workflows utilized local and remote `postgreSQL` databases as well as a "snapshot" of select datasets contained within a local `sqlite` database. A data and script repository to facilitate this reporting is located on [Github](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/fish_passage_elk_2021_reporting).

```

## Planning

 
Priorities for site assessment locations were provided by Canadian Wildlife Federation with some additional sites selected by field crews based on background literature, fisheries information, PSCIS, `bcfishpass` [@norris2021smnorrisbcfishpass] outputs and field reconnaissance. `bcfishpass` is an open-source code repository that models aquatic connectivity based on a suite of hard coded (maximum stream slope downstream, PSCIS barrier information, [dam locations](https://github.com/smnorris/bcdams) and user defined parameters ([gradient/width/discharge](https://github.com/smnorris/bcfishpass/tree/main/02_model/parameters_wcrp)).  Details of the general methodology can be found [here](https://github.com/smnorris/bcfishpass) and may be updated over time as the tool evolves.  Once a development environment is properly setup, the software builds a local `postgresql` database through the utilization of other open-source tools such as [`bcdata`](https://github.com/smnorris/bcdata) [@norris2021smnorrisbcdata], [`bcfishobs`](https://github.com/smnorris/bcfishobs) [@norris2021smnorrisbcfishobs], and [`fwapg`](https://github.com/smnorris/fwapg) [@norris2021smnorrisfwapg] to provide connectivity models developed from analysis of the BC Freshwater Atlas, road layers,  fisheries information, Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium stream discharge data, measured and [modeled estimates of channel width](https://www.poissonconsulting.ca/temporary-hidden-link/859859031/channel-width-21b/) and numerous other standardized datasets downloaded directly from the [BC Data Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/) application programming interface using `bcdata`.


<br>

### Accessible Habitat 

`bcfishpass` calculates the average gradient of BC Freshwater Atlas stream network lines at minimum 100m long intervals starting from the downstream end of the streamline segment and working upstream.  The network lines are broken into max gradient categories with new segments created if and when the average slope of the stream line segment exceeds user provided thresholds. For this project, the user provided gradient thresholds used to delineate "potentially accessible habitat" were based on estimated max gradients that westslope cutthrout trout (22%) are likely to be capable of ascending. `bcfishpass` identifes natural barriers (ex. steep gradients for extended distances) and hydroelectric dams to classifying the accessibility upstream by fish [@norris2021smnorrisbcfishpass]. On potentially accessible streams, scripts identify known barriers (ex. waterfalls >5m high) and additional anthropogenic features which are primarily road/railway stream crossings (i.e. culverts) that are potentially barriers. To prioritize these features for assessment or remediation, scripts report on how much modelled potentially accessible aquatic habitat the barriers may obstruct. The model can be refined with known fish observations upstream of identified barriers and for each crossing location, the area of lake and wetland habitat upstream, species documented upstream/downstream, an estimate of watershed area (on 2nd order and higher streams), estimates of discharge, mean annual precipitation weighted to upstream watershed area and channel width.  This, information, can be used to provides an indication of the potential quantity and quality of habitat potentially gained should fish passage be restored by comparing to user defined thresholds for the aforementioned parameters. 

<br>


`bcfishpass` and associated tools have been designed to be flexible in analysis, accepting user defined gradient, channel width and stream discharge categories [@moeStreamInventorySample].  Although currently in draft form, and subject to development revisions, Canadian Wildlife Federation assigned gradient and discharge thresholds for habitat with the highest intrinsic value for westslope cutthrout trout have been estimated and applied to model habitat upstream of stream crossing locations (Table \@ref(tab:tab-fish-spawning-rearing)).  Thresholds were derived based on a literature review with references provided in Table \@ref(tab:tab-fish-spawning-rearing-references).

### PSCIS and Modelled Stream Crossing Review

In addition to direction for site selection provided by an internal exercise conducted by CWF, to prepare for Phase 1 and 2 assessments in the study area, past fish passage assessment reports for the Elk River watershed group were first reviewed to identify crossing structures not yet assessed or previously ranked as priorities for rehabilitation in @irvine2016ColumbiaBasin; @vastFishPassage2013 and @grainger2011FishPassage2011.  To determine which of those crossings had not yet been assessed with Phase 1 and Phase 2 assessments we cross-referenced these reports with the Phase 2 report previously completed in the study area [@masseEKConfirmation2015; @vastresourcesolutionsinc_2013FishHabitat] and reviewed outputs from PSCIS as well as `bcfishpass`.  Outputs for modeled and PSCIS crossings (barriers and potential barriers) that met the following criteria underwent a detailed review to facilitate prioritization for Phase1 - Fish Passage Assessments and Phase 2 - Habitat Confirmations.

 * Confirmed fish presence upstream of the PSCIS or modelled structure.
 * Stream width documented as > 2.0m in PSCIS.
 * Habitat value rated as "medium" or “high” in PSCIS.
 * For PSCIS crossings: linear lengths of modelled upstream habitat <22% gradient for ≥1km 
 * For modelled crossings crossings: linear lengths of modelled upstream habitat <22% gradient for ≥2km and no anthropogenic barriers (including modelled potential stream crossing structures) documented downstream.
 * Crossings located on streams classified as 3rd order or higher.

In the field, crossings prioritized for follow-up were first assessed for fish passage following the procedures outlined in “Field Assessment for Determining Fish Passage Status of Closed Bottomed Structures” [@fish_passage_assessments]. Crossings surveyed included closed bottom structures (CBS), open bottom structures (OBS) and crossings considered “other” (i.e. fords).  Photos were taken at surveyed crossings and when possible included images of the road, crossing inlet, crossing outlet, crossing barrel, channel downstream and channel upstream of the crossing and any other relevant features.  The following information was recorded for all surveyed crossings: date of inspection, crossing reference, crew member initials, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, stream name, road name and kilometer, road tenure information, crossing type, crossing subtype, culvert diameter or span for OBS, culvert length or width for OBS.  A more detailed “full assessment” was completed for all closed bottom structures and included the following parameters: presence/absence of continuous culvert embedment (yes/no), average depth of embedment, whether or not the culvert bed resembled the native stream bed, presence of and percentage backwatering, fill depth, outlet drop, outlet pool depth, inlet drop, culvert slope, average downstream channel width, stream slope, presence/absence of beaver activity, presence/absence of fish at time of survey, type of valley fill, and a habitat value rating.  Habitat value ratings were based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), fish migration patterns, the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation (Table \@ref(tab:tab-hab-value)).  For crossings determined to be potential barriers or barriers based on the data (see [Barrier Scoring]), a culvert fix and recommended diameter/span was proposed.

```

### Barrier Scoring

Fish passage potential was determined for each stream crossing identified as a closed bottom structure as per @fish_passage_assessments.  The combined scores from five criteria: depth and degree to which the structure is embedded, outlet drop, stream width ratio, culvert slope, and culvert length were used to screen whether each culvert was a likely barrier to some fish species and life stages (Table \@ref(tab:tab-barrier-scoring), Table \@ref(tab:tab-barrier-result). These criteria were developed based on data obtained from various studies and reflect an estimation for the passage of a juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout [@clarkinNationalInventoryAssessment2005 ;@bellFisheriesHandbookEngineering1991; @thompsonAssessingFishPassage2013].  

<br>

```{r tab-barrier-scoring, eval=T}
tab <- as_tibble(t(tab_barrier_scoring)) %>% 
  mutate(V4 = names(tab_barrier_scoring)) %>% 
  select(V4, everything()) %>% 
  janitor::row_to_names(1) %>%  ##turn the table sideways
  mutate(Risk = case_when(Risk == 'Value' ~ '  Value',
                          T ~ Risk))

tab %>% 
  my_kable(caption_text = 'Fish Barrier Risk Assessment (MoE 2011).')

```

<br>


```{r tab-barrier-result}
tab_barrier_result %>% 
  my_kable(caption_text = 'Fish Barrier Scoring Results (MoE 2011).') 

```

<br>

### Cost Benefit Analysis

A cost benefit analysis was conducted for each crossing determined to be a barrier based on an estimate of cost associated with remediation or replacement of the crossing with a structure that facilitates fish passage and the amount of potential habitat that would be made available by remediation of fish passage at the site (habitat gain index). 

<br>

#### Habitat Gain Index

The habitat gain index is the quantity of modeled habitat upstream of the subject crossing and represents an estimate of habitat gained with remediation of fish passage at the crossing.  For this project,  a gradient threshold between accessible and non-accessible habitat was set at 22% (for a minimum length of 100m) to represent the maximum gradient of which the strongest swimmers of westslope cutthrout trout are likely to be able to migrate upstream.  

<br>

For reporting of Phase 1 - fish passage assessments within the body of this report (Table \@ref(tab:tab-barrier-scoring)), a "total" value of habitat <22% output from `bcfishpass` was used to estimate the amount of habitat upstream of each crossing less than 22% gradient before a falls of height >5m - as recorded in @ProvincialObstaclesFish or documented in other `bcfishpass` online documentation. To generate areas of habitat upstream, the estimated linear length was multiplied by the downstream channel width measured as part of the fish passage assessment protocol.  Although these estimates are not generally conservative, have low accuracy and do not account for upstream stream crossing structures they do allow a rough screening to help facilitate the decision making process for selecting the best candidates for follow up with more detailed Phase 2 assessments. 

<br>

For Phase 2 - habitat confirmation sites, conservative estimates of the linear quantity of habitat suitable for rearing and spawning of westslope cutthrout trout to be potentially gained by fish passage restoration, mainstem and large tributary streams (>1st order streams) segments upstream of each crossing with freshwater atlas stream layer gradients <8% and modelled at >2m wide (likely of highest value for rearing and spawning westslope cutthrout trout), below natural/manmade barriers and downstream of documented culvert barriers were measured by hand with the measure tool within QGIS [@QGIS_software]. To generate estimates of the area of habitat upstream of these sites, the length of habitat was multiplied by the upstream average channel width that was measured in the field.

<br>


Potential options to remediate fish passage were selected from @fish_passage_assessments and included:  

 + Removal (RM) - Complete removal of the structure and deactivation of the road. 
 + Open Bottom Structure (OBS) - Replacement of the culvert with a bridge or other open bottom structure.  For this project we considered bridges as the only viable option for OBS type based on consultation with FLNR road crossing engineering experts.  It should be noted however, that box culverts could be considered a viable and economical option as they have been observed as successfully facilitating fish passage on the west coast of the province (Betty Rebellato, Canadian Wildlife Federation - Project Biologist).
 + Streambed Simulation (SS) - Replacement of the structure with a streambed simulation design culvert.  Often achieved by embedding the culvert by 40% or more. Based on consultation with FLNR engineering experts, we considered crossings on streams with a channel width of <2m and a stream gradient of <8% as candidates for replacement with streambed simulations.
 + Additional Substrate Material (EM) - Add additional substrate to the culvert and/or downstream weir to embed culvert and reduce overall velocity/turbulence.  This option was considered only when outlet drop = 0, culvert slope <1.0% and stream width ratio < 1.0.
 + Backwater (BW) - Backwatering of the structure to reduce velocity and turbulence. This option was considered only when outlet drop < 0.3m, culvert slope <2.0%, stream width ratio < 1.2 and stream profiling indicates it would be effective.
 
 <br>

Cost estimates for structure replacement with bridges and embedded culverts were generated based on the channel width, slope of the culvert, depth of fill, road class and road surface type. Road details were sourced from @flnrordForestTenureRoad2020 and @flnrordDigitalRoadAtlas2020 through `bcfishpass`. Interviews with Phil MacDonald, Engineering Specialist FLNR - Kootenay, Steve Page, Area Engineer - FLNR - Northern Engineering Group and Matt Hawkins - MoTi - Design Supervisor for Highway Design and Survey - Nelson, David Maloney - FLNR - Fish Passage Technical Working Group were utilized to help refine estimates.  

<br>

Base costs for installation of bridges on forest service roads and permit roads with surfaces specified in provincial GIS road layers as rough and loose was roughly estimated at \$20,000/linear m and assumed that the road could be closed during construction. For streams with channel widths <2m, embedded culverts were reported as an effective solution with total installation costs roughly estimated at \$40k/crossing so as to take into account the rising costs of materials and labour since the original estimate of \$25k/crossing was communicated in early 2021 (pers. comm. Phil MacDonald, Steve Page). For larger streams (>6m), estimates of bridge span width increased proportionally to the size of the stream (ex. for an 8m wide stream a 14m wide span was estimated vs. the 12m wide span estimated for a 6m wide stream).  For crossings with large amounts of fill (>3m), the replacement bridge span was increased by an additional 3m for each 1m of fill >3m to account for cutslopes to the stream at a 1.5:1 ratio. To account for road type, a multiplier table was also generated to estimate incremental cost increases with dollar amounts estimated for structure replacement on paved surfaces, railways and arterial/highways up to 30 times more than forest service roads due to expenses associated with design/engineering requirements, traffic control and paving.  The cost multiplier table (Table \@ref(tab:tab-cost-mult)) should be considered very approximate with refinement recommended for future projects.

# print_tab_cost_mult(caption_text = 'Cost multiplier table based on road class and surface type.')
tab_cost_rd_mult_report %>%
  my_kable(caption_text = 'Cost multiplier table based on road class and surface type.')
```

<br>

## Habitat Confirmation Assessments

Following fish passage assessments, habitat confirmations were completed in accordance with procedures outlined in the document “A Checklist for Fish Habitat Confirmation Prior to the Rehabilitation of a Stream Crossing” [@confirmation_checklist_2011]. The main objective of the field surveys was to document upstream habitat quantity and quality as well as to determine if any other obstructions exist above or below the crossing.  Habitat value was assessed based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), the presence/absence of deep  pools, un-embedded  boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation. Criteria used to rank habitat value was based on guidelines in @confirmation_checklist_2011 (Table \@ref(tab:tab-hab-value)). 

<br>

During habitat confirmations, to standardize data collected and facilitate submission of the data to provincial databases, information was collated on ["Site Cards"](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/laws-policies-standards-guidance/inventory-standards/aquatic-ecosystems). Habitat characteristics recorded included channel widths, wetted widths, residual pool depths, gradients, bankfull depths, stage, temperature, conductivity, pH, cover by type, substrate and channel morphology (among others). When possible, the crew surveyed downstream of the crossing to the point where fish presence had been previously confirmed and upstream to a minimum distance of 600m. Any  potential  obstacles  to  fish  passage  were  inventoried  with  photos, physical  descriptions  and  locations  recorded on site cards.  Surveyed routes were recorded with time-signatures on handheld GPS units.

## Mapping

Mapping was completed by Hillcrest Geographics.  `pdf` maps were generated using `QGIS` with data supplied via a `postgreSQL` database.  A QGIS layer file defining and symbolizing all layers required for general fish passage mapping was developed and at the time of reporting was kept under version control within `bcfishpass`.

## Phase 1

Field assessments were conducted between `r format(min(pscis_phase1$date), format="%B %d %Y")` and `r format(max(pscis_phase1$date), format="%B %d %Y")` by Allan Irvine, R.P.Bio., Kyle Prince, P.Biol., Stevie Syer, Rafael Acosta Lugo and Brody Klenk. A total of `r n_distinct(pscis_phase1$my_crossing_reference)` Phase 1 assessments were conducted with `r pscis_phase1 %>% filter(barrier_result == 'Passable') %>% nrow()` crossings considered "passable", `r pscis_phase1 %>% filter(barrier_result == 'Potential') %>% nrow() %>% english::as.english()` crossings considered "potential" barriers and `r pscis_phase1 %>% filter(barrier_result == 'Barrier') %>% nrow()` crossings considered "barriers" according to threshold values based on culvert embedment, outlet drop, slope, diameter (relative to channel size) and length [@fish_passage_assessments].  Additionally, although all were considered fully passable, `r pscis_phase1 %>% filter(barrier_result == 'Potential') %>% nrow() %>% english::as.english()` crossings assessed were fords with a barrier ranking of "unknown". Georeferenced field maps are presented in `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("[here](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/outgoing/fishpassage/projects/elk/) and available for bulk download as [Attachment 1](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/outgoing/fishpassage/projects/elk/archive/2021-01-31/elk_2021-01-31.zip).")} else knitr::asis_output("[Attachment 1](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/outgoing/fishpassage/projects/elk/archive/2021-01-31/elk_2021-01-31.zip).")` A summary of crossings assessed, a cost benefit analysis and priority ranking for follow up for Phase 1 sites presented in Table \@ref(tab:cost-est-phase-1). Detailed data with photos are presented in `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("[Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos]")} else knitr::asis_output("[Attachment 3](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/fish_passage_bulkley_2020_reporting/raw/master/docs/Attachment_3_Phase_1_Data_and_Photos.pdf)")`.


<br>

"Barrier" and "Potential Barrier" rankings used in this project followed @fish_passage_assessments and reflect an assessment of passability for juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout at any flows potentially present throughout the year [@clarkinNationalInventoryAssessment2005 ;@bellFisheriesHandbookEngineering1991; @thompsonAssessingFishPassage2013].  As noted in @bourne_etal2011Barriersfish, with a detailed review of different criteria in @kemp_ohanley2010Proceduresevaluating, passability of barriers can be quantified in many different ways. Fish physiology (i.e. species, length, swim speeds) can make defining passability complex but with important implications for evaluating connectivity and prioritizing remediation candidates [@bourne_etal2011Barriersfish; @shaw_etal2016Importancepartial; @mahlum_etal2014EvaluatingBarrier; @kemp_ohanley2010Proceduresevaluating].  @washingtondepartmentoffishwildlife2009FishPassage present criteria for assigning passability scores to culverts that have already been assessed as barriers in coarser level assessments.  These passability scores provide additional information to feed into decision making processes related to the prioritization of remediation site candidates and have potential for application in British Columbia.

## Phase 2

During 2020 field assessments, habitat confirmation assessments were conducted at `r hab_site_priorities %>% nrow() - 1` sites in the Bulkley River watershed group and one site in the Morice River watershed group.  A total of approximately 18 km of stream was assessed, fish sampling utilizing electrofishing and/or minnowtrapping was conducted at eight sites, and three sites were mapped using remotely piloted aircraft. Of note, in 2020, surveys in some larger mid Bulkley River tributaries with high potential low gradient habitat gains (ex. Toboggan Creek and John Brown Creek) were not conducted due to poor survey conditions caused by high water.  Additionally, assessment at crossings on some large tributary streams in the upper Bulkley River were not conducted due to finite quantities of field time (ex. Ailport Creek, Cesford Creek and Watson Creek). Georeferenced field maps are presented in `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("[here](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/outgoing/fishpassage/projects/elk/) and available for bulk download as [Attachment 1](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/outgoing/fishpassage/projects/elk/archive/2021-01-31/elk_2021-01-31.zip).")} else knitr::asis_output("[Attachment 1](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/outgoing/fishpassage/projects/elk/archive/2021-01-31/elk_2021-01-31.zip).")`

As collaborative decision making was ongoing at the time of reporting, site prioritization can be considered preliminary.  In total, `r hab_site_priorities %>% filter(priority %ilike% 'high') %>% nrow() %>% english::as.english() %>% str_to_title()` crossings were rated as high priorities for proceeding to design for replacement, `r hab_site_priorities %>% filter(priority %ilike% 'Moderate') %>% nrow() %>% english::as.english()` crossings were rated as moderate priorities, and `r hab_site_priorities %>% filter(priority %ilike% 'Low') %>% nrow() %>% english::as.english()` crossings were rated as low priorities. Results are summarized in `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("Figure \\@ref(fig:map-interactive) and ")}`Table \@ref(tab:tab-overview)) with raw habitat and fish sampling data included in digital format as [Attachment 4](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/fish_passage_elk_2021_reporting/raw/master/data/habitat_confirmations.xls).  A summary of watershed statistics from derived watershed areas andpreliminary modelling results illustrating the quantities of westslope cutthrout trout spawning and rearing habitat potentially available upstream of each crossing as estimated by measured/modeled channel width and upstream accessible stream length are presented in Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-sum-all) and Figure \@ref(fig:plot-model-all). Detailed information for each site assessed with Phase 2 assessments (including maps) are presented within site specific appendices to this document.

# Recommendations

Although remediation and replacement of stream crossing structures can have benefits to local fish populations [@saldicaromileStreamHabitatRestoration2004; @roni_etal2008GlobalReview], the costs of remedial works can be significant and the impacts of the work on fisheries communities often complex to evaluate and quantify.  The potential cost benefits, ethical dynamics and feasibility of ecosystem restoration funding allocation towards infrastructure upgrades on transportation right of ways should be explored collaboratively alongside the cost benefits, ethical dynamics and feasibility of alternative/additional investment activities such as transportation corridor relocation/deactivation, land procurement/covenant, cattle exclusion, riparian restoration, habitat complexing, water conservation, commercial/recreational fishing management and research.

## Site Location {-}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_name)` on the `r my_overview_info() %>% pull(road_name)` 11km east of Elkford, BC. PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` is located approximately 30m downstream of the railway on the `r my_overview_info(site = my_site2) %>% pull(road_name)`.  The `r my_overview_info(site = my_site2) %>% pull(road_name)` is detailed as a local road within the municipal boundaries of the District of Elkford with the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure detailed as a custodian partner within the digital road atlas [@flnrord2020DigitalRoad]. The road accesses the Fording River Operations which is a steelmaking coal operation owned by Teck Coal Limited.


<br>

## Background {-}


`r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_name)` drains in a northern direction to the confluence with the Fording River at a location approximately 10km east of Elkford, BC. At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_name)` is a `r my_bcfishpass() %>% pull(stream_order) %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately `r fpr_wshd_par()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 2280 to 1540m at PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)`. `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_name)` is known to contain `r my_fish_sp()` upstream of the subject culvert [@data_fish_obs; @norris2020bcfishobs]. There are numerous stream crossing structures located on `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_name)` upstream of `r as.character(my_site)` however there are no crossings assessed as barriers on the mainstem to directly below the location of the wasterock as indicated by aerial imagery. Dry Creek drains into to the Fording River upstream of Josephine Falls, a 25 m waterfall that limits the upstream passage of fish [@teckcoallimitedlinecreekoperations2009LineCreek].


<br>

The upper end of the watershed is within Phase II of Teck Coal Limited’s (Teck) – Line Creek Operation area (LCOII).  @hasek_batchelar20212020Line report that waste rock placement in the watershed began in 2015.  A review of aerial imagery from March of 2021 indicated that the total area of waste rock placement within the watershed was approximately 300ha. In order to comply with discharge requirements for total suspended solids (Permit 106970), Teck began operating the Line Creek Operation Dry Creek Water Management System (LCODCWMS) in 2015. The LCODCWMS collects upper Dry Creek water in a headpond which then conveys the water into two lined sedimentation ponds.  Discharge from the sedimentation ponds is subsequently combined and is conveyed to a constructed discharge channel which flows continuously into Dry Creek downstream.  The Line Creek Operations Local Aquatic Effects Monitoring Program (LCOLAEMP) to assess potential effects of Line Creek Operations on Dry Creek, Grace Creek and an Unnamed Creek has been in operation since 2014 as per another LCOII permitting requirement [@hasek_batchelar20212020Line].  A Structured Decision Making (SDM) process was initiated in 2016 to develop recommendations for water qualty site performatnce objective (SPOs) and in-stream flow requirements (IFRs) for Dry Creek, along with an updated LCO Dry Creek Water Management Plan that included water management activities, physical ,works, and LCOII operational procedures with the entent to acheieve the recommneded SPOs and IFRs, to inform monitoring as well as adaptive management recommendations.  The SDM process includes a working group comprised of Ktunaxa Nation Council; BC Ministry of Environment; Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development; the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources; Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Teck.  The SDM process develops operational recommendations informed throughout the year by the LCOLAEM with results from 2020 summarized below [@hasek_batchelar20212020Line]. 


  1. Aqueous concentrations of nitrate, sulphate, nickel, selenium, total cadmium, and other constituents were greater within Dry Creek than reference and normal ranges with frequent guideline and benchmark exceedances.
  2. Water collected at the outlet of the LCODCWMS had no increases in acute toxicity in 2020 and water sampled from within Dry Creek had no change in frequency or severity of potential adverse responses in chronic toxicity testing. 
  3. Multiple metrics of benthic invertebrate community composition that indicate negative water quality effects (decreasing %Ephemeroptera , decreaseing %EPT, increasing %Chironomidae) were noted at multiple Dry Creek sample sites in 2020.
  4. Benthic invertebrate tissue selenium concentrations were observed to be greater than normal range in samples from all areas
downstream of the LCODCWMS.  
  5. In response to 3 and 4, operational changes to the LCODCWMS were implemented in 2020 to minimize the retention time in the pond to reduce bioaccumulation of selenium. Water from the headpond bypassed the sedimentation ponds seasonally, only filling them during freshet and higher-flow periods. 
  
<br>

A pipeline and power line corridor (Dry Creek Water Conveyance and Supplementation Project) are currently under construction in the watershed to mitigate the risks to the water quality / flow regulation in Dry Creek and meet site performance measures and instream flow requirements [@burns_etal202121463789Teck; @chapman_hatfield2021LCODry].  The project infrastructure  will collect mine-affected water in the headwaters of Dry Creek and divert it into the Fording River while water from the Fording River upstream of the Dry Creek conveyance outlet will be pumped to Dry Creek at or near the point of diversion. @chapman_hatfield2021LCODry conducted Fisheries Habitat Assessment Procedure (FHAP) surveys and mapping in the Fording River and a perrenial tributary to Dry Creek (T5) in 2021 to supplement FHAP data collected in the mainstem of Dry Creek by @buchanan_etal2017DryCreek and support the design and permitting for the project.

<br>


@cope2020UpperFording have conducted three pass removal depletion electrofishing in the lower section of Dry Creek below crossing `r as.character(my_site)` as part of the Upper Fording River Westslope Ctthroat Trout Population Monitoring Project in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017 and 2019 with fish densities sampled ranging from 2.25 to 16.5 fish/100m^2. Sampling was continued in 2020 along with redd surveys in the lower reach of the stream with results presented in @thorley_etal2021UpperFording.  Analysis by @thorley_etal2021UpperFording indicates that there was a substantial decline in the number of adult westslope cutthroat trout in the Upper Fording River between 2017 and 2019 with no evidence of further decline between 2019 and 2020 suggesting the mortality may have been due to a short-term event opposed to chronic conditions.   

<br>


In 2014, PSCIS stream crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` were the sites of habitat confirmation assessments by @masseenvironmentalconsultantsltd_2015FishHabitat. The crossings were subjectively assessed as passable during the field assessments due to the low gradients and embeddedness of the pipes with the crossings not recommended for replacement at that time.  @masseenvironmentalconsultantsltd_2015FishHabitat did however recommend reassessment of the sites every 5 to 10 years due to likely substrate movement at the crossing locations. Upon review of this background reporting, and due to the likely presence of significant quantities of upstream habitat suitable for WCT rearing and spawning based on `bcfishpass` outputs, the Canadian Wildlife Federation assigned these sites as high priorities for follow up. A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment [`r my_bcfishpass() %>% pull(dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r my_mapsheet()`).

<br>

Permit 107517, issued to Teck in November 2014 under provisions of the *Environmental Management Act* required development of a Tributary Management Plan for tributaries to the Elk and Fording Rivers that will incorporate protection and rehabilitation goals for tributaries to support achieving the area-based objectives of the Elk Valley Water Quality Plan [@teckcoallimited2020TributaryManagement; @teckresourceslimited2014ElkValley].  As part of the Tributary Management Plan, design work for  fish passage improvement at the Highway and Railway is scheduled for 2021-2022 based on pre-construction data that was scheduled to be collected in 2021.  Construction of restoration works has been slated for 2023 based on progress of a partnership and agreement on design between the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, CP Railway and Teck [@teckcoallimited2020TributaryManagement].


## Stream Characteristics at Crossings {-}

At the time of the survey, the PSCIS crossing `r my_site` was embedded, non-backwatered and considered a potential barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial metric. The pipes were `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(diameter_or_span_meters)`m each in diameter with lengths of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(length_or_width_meters)`m, culvert slopes of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(culvert_slope_percent)`%, a stream width ratio of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_width_ratio)` and an outlet drop of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(outlet_drop_meters)`m (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-62181)). Water temperature was `r my_habitat_info(sit = my_site2) %>% filter(rowname == 'temperature c') %>% pull(us)`$^\circ$C, pH was `r my_habitat_info(sit = my_site2) %>% filter(rowname == 'p h') %>% pull(us)` and conductivity was `r my_habitat_info(sit = my_site2) %>% filter(rowname == 'conductivity m s cm') %>% pull(us)`uS/cm.  

```{r eval = F}
my_pscis_info_out %>% pull(assessment_comment)
```

<br>

PSCIS crossing `r my_site2` was comprised of two pipes. As per the provincial methodology, only data from the pipe with the lowest outlet elevation was entered into the provincial database [@moe2011Fieldassessment].  Although the lower of the two 1.8m diameter pipes was embedded for the majority of its length, it was not embedded near the inlet and there was a significantly sized inlet drop present (0.4m).  The crossing was non-backwatered and considered a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial metric. The pipe lengths were `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(length_or_width_meters)`m, with the lower elevation pipe slope measured at `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(culvert_slope_percent)`%.  The stream width ratio was `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_width_ratio)` and the outlet drop was `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(outlet_drop_meters)`m (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-62182)).

```{r eval=F}
##this is useful to get some comments for the report
hab_site %>% filter(site == my_site2 & location == 'ds') %>% pull(comments)
my_priority <-  my_priority_info()

```

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {-}

The stream was surveyed downstream from `r as.character(my_site2)` for `r my_priority_info(loc = 'ds', sit = my_site2) %>% pull(survey_length_m)`m `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-62181-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-62181-02))")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-62181-d01))"))`. Overall, total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'ds', sit = my_site2) %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(v)` with  `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'ds', sit = my_site2) %>% filter(v == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` dominant. Cover was also present as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'ds', sit = my_site2) %>% filter(v == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` (Table \@ref(tab:tab-habitat-summary-62181)). The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', sit = my_site2, row = 'avg channel width m')`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', sit = my_site2, row = 'avg wetted width m')`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', sit = my_site2, row = 'average gradient percent')`%. The dominant substrate was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', sit = my_site2, row = "bed material dominant")` with `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', sit = my_site2, row = "bed material subdominant")` subdominant.  During the downstream survey the stream was observed to be quite open with all riparian vegetation comprised as shrub before transitioning into mature mixed forest. Pools and undercut banks were noted with their frequency increasing further downstream. The stream was noted as very braided at times and had appeared to have shifted into a new channel, indicated by fine substrate, mid stream standing and dead conifers and no major channel development (ie. wetted channel was equivalent to channel width in these areas). Substrate was noted well outside the normal high water mark suggesting high flows and channel movement. Sharp bends in the stream resulted in deep pools and  undercut banks. A climate and hydrometric station was observed downstream of the highway in first few hundred meters. Habitat value was rated as `r my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'ds') %>%  pull(hab_value)`. 

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {-}

```{r eval = F}
# as a note - we are using my_sit = my_site2 because the detailed info was recorded on that card
```


The stream was surveyed upstream from `r as.character(my_site)` for `r my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% pull(survey_length_m)`m `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-62181-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-62181-04))")} else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-62181-d02))"))`. Environmental monitoring system sample location E288270 (EQuiS: LC_DC1) was located approximately 100m upstream of the railway at the bridge on the Fording FSR. In the area surveyed, total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us', sit = my_site2) %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(v)` with  `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us', sit = my_site2) %>% filter(v == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` dominant. Cover was also present as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us', sit = my_site2) %>% filter(v == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` (Table \@ref(tab:tab-habitat-summary-62181)). The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', , sit = my_site2, row = 'avg channel width m')`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = 'avg wetted width m')`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', , sit = my_site2, row = 'average gradient percent')`%.  Habitat value was rated as `r my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% pull(hab_value)` for salmonid rearing and spawning due to good flow, larger channel size, occasional pockets of gravel and the presence of intermittent pools.

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {-}

Structure replacement with a bridge (`r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m span) is recommended to provide access to the habitat located upstream of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)`. The cost of the work is estimated at \$`r format(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_est_1000s) * 1000, big.mark = ',')` for a cost benefit of `r as.character(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_net))` linear m/\$1000 and `r as.character(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_area_net))`m^2^/\$1000.


<br>


## Conclusion {-}

There is an estimated `r my_priority_info() %>% pull(upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of mainstem habitat upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` to the LCODCWMS headpond.  Habitat in the area surveyed was rated as `r my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us') %>% pull(hab_value)` value for salmonid rearing/spawning.  The railway is the responsibility of Canadian Pacific Rail and the highway appears to be the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure.  The crossing was ranked as a `r my_priority_info() %>% pull(priority)` priority for proceeding to design for replacement.  Line Creek watershed is within Phase II of Teck Coal Limited’s – Line Creek Operation area with a wealth of past and current information regarding the stream available including detailed habitat assessment, water quality, benthic invertebrate, toxicity and flow data gathered through the ongoing Line Creek Operations Local Aquatic Effects Monitoring Program. At the time of reporting, the Dry Creek Water Conveyance and Supplementation Project was under construction and fish passage restoration works at the highway and railway were planned for 2023 through Teck's Tributary Management Plan and based on progress of a potential partnership and agreement on design between the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, CP Railway and Teck [@burns_etal202121463789Teck; @chapman_hatfield2021LCODry; @teckcoallimited2020TributaryManagement].

## Site Location {-}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_name)` on the `r my_overview_info() %>% pull(road_name)` approximately 35km south-east of Fernie, BC and accessed from the Lodgepole FSR. PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` is located approximately 875 upstream of `r as.character(my_site)` and is also on the `r my_overview_info(site = my_site2) %>% pull(road_name)`.  The `r my_overview_info(site = my_site2) %>% pull(road_name)` (forest file ID 5466) is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development District Manager for the Rocky Mountain Forest District [@flnrord2020ForestTenure]. 


<br>

## Background {-}


`r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_name)` drains in a generally western direction to the confluence with the Wigwam River before flowing 10km to the Elk River at a location approximately 7km downstream of the Elko Dam. At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_name)` is a `r my_bcfishpass() %>% pull(stream_order) %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately `r fpr_wshd_par()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of `r fpr_wshd_par(col = 'elev_max')`m to `r fpr_wshd_par(col = 'elev_min')`m  near PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` (Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-197787)). `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_name)` is known to contain `r my_fish_sp()` upstream of the subject culvert [@data_fish_obs; @norris2020bcfishobs]. The only stream crossing upstream of `r as.character(my_site)` on the mainstem of the stream before extreme gradients is crossing `r as.character(my_site2)`. Lodgepole Lake is located approximately 300m upstream of `r as.character(my_site)` and is approximately 2ha in area.

fpr_tab_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %>%

           footnote_text = 'Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above')
```

<br>


Due to the potential for significant quantities of upstream habitat suitable for WCT rearing and spawning based on `bcfishpass` outputs, the Canadian Wildlife Federation assigned these sites as high priorities for follow up. A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment [`r my_bcfishpass() %>% pull(dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r my_mapsheet()`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossings {-}

At the time of the survey, the PSCIS crossing `r my_site` was un-embedded, non-backwatered and considered a potential barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial metric. The pipes were `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(diameter_or_span_meters)`m each in diameter with lengths of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(length_or_width_meters)`m, culvert slopes of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(culvert_slope_percent)`%, a stream width ratio of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_width_ratio)` and an outlet drop of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(outlet_drop_meters)`m (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-197787)). Water temperature was `r my_habitat_info(sit = my_site2) %>% filter(rowname == 'temperature c') %>% pull(us)`$^\circ$C, pH was `r my_habitat_info(sit = my_site2) %>% filter(rowname == 'p h') %>% pull(us)` and conductivity was `r my_habitat_info(sit = my_site2) %>% filter(rowname == 'conductivity m s cm') %>% pull(us)`uS/cm.  

```{r eval = F}
my_pscis_info_out %>% pull(assessment_comment)
```

<br>

PSCIS crossing `r my_site2` was comprised of two pipes. As per the provincial methodology, because the outlet height of each of the two 1m pipes were equivalent, the diameters of the two pipes were summed for input into PSCIS and the the stream width ratio was calculated as though the structure diameter was 2m [@moe2011Fieldassessment].  The crossing was non-embedded, not backwatered and considered a potential barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial metric. The pipe lengths were `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(length_or_width_meters)`m, with pipe slopes measured at `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(culvert_slope_percent)`%.  The stream width ratio was `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_width_ratio)` and the outlet drop was `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(outlet_drop_meters)`m (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-197786)).

```{r eval=F}
##this is useful to get some comments for the report
hab_site %>% filter(site == my_site2 & location == 'us') %>% pull(comments)
my_priority <-  my_priority_info()

```

## Stream Characteristics Downstream of `r as.character(my_site)` {-}

The stream was surveyed downstream from `r as.character(my_site)` for `r my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') %>% pull(survey_length_m)`m `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197787-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197787-02))")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197787-d01))"))`. Overall, total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'ds') %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(v)` with  `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'ds') %>% filter(v == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` dominant. Cover was also present as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'ds') %>% filter(v == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` (Table \@ref(tab:tab-habitat-summary-197787)). The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = 'avg channel width m')`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = 'avg wetted width m')`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = 'average gradient percent')`%. The dominant substrate was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = "bed material dominant")` with `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = "bed material subdominant")` subdominant. Habitat value was rated as `r my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') %>%  pull(hab_value)` as it was considered an important migration corridor with moderate value habitat for fry/juvenile salmonid rearing.  

<br>

A 10m high falls was reported as present within the Provincial Obstacles to Fish Passage spatial spatial layer of the provincial Data Catalogue in the mainstem of Lodgepole Creek approximately 12.5km downstream of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)`  [@moe2020ProvincialObstacles].  The potential presence of this falls was considered relevant for assessment of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` so a 1100m section of stream was surveyed spanning the reported falls location (survey track is shown in map attachment [`r my_bcfishpass() %>% pull(dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r my_mapsheet()`)). No falls were observed within the area surveyed.

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of `r as.character(my_site)` and downstream of `r as.character(my_site2)`{-}

```{r eval = F}
# as a note - we are using my_sit = my_site2 because the detailed info was recorded on that card
```


The stream was surveyed upstream from `r as.character(my_site)` for `r my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% pull(survey_length_m)`m to the outlet of Lodgepole Lake where a beaver dam ~1.2m in height was observed `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197787-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197787-06))")} else(knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197787-d02) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197787-d03))"))`. Numerous fish (150 - 200m) were observed above the beaver dam.  Within the area surveyed, total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us') %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(v)` with  `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us') %>% filter(v == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` dominant. Cover was also present as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us') %>% filter(v == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` (Table \@ref(tab:tab-habitat-summary-197787)). The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = 'avg channel width m')`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = 'avg wetted width m')`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = 'average gradient percent')`%.  Abundant gravels suitable for spawning were observed between the FSR and the lake outlet. Within this area of the survey the stream primarily had low complexity due to the prevalence of straight riffle type habitat.  Some shallow pools and large woody debris were present. Habitat value was rated as `r my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% pull(hab_value)` value due to the presence of spawning gravels as well as the lake which likely provides overwintering habitat for resident westslope cutthrout trout. 


<br>


The stream was surveyed downstream from `r as.character(my_site2)` for `r my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'ds') %>% pull(survey_length_m)`m to the inlet of Lodgepole Lake `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197787-07) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197787-08))")} else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197787-d04))"))`. Within the area surveyed, total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us') %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(v)` with  `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us') %>% filter(v == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` dominant. Cover was also present as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us') %>% filter(v == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` (Table \@ref(tab:tab-habitat-summary-197787)). The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = 'avg channel width m')`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = 'avg wetted width m')`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = 'average gradient percent')`%.  Abundant gravels suitable for spawning were observed between the FSR and the lake outlet. The channel dewatered in a section from approximately 160m upstream of the lake to the lake. Substrate in the upstream, watered portion of the stream below the culvert was comprised of gravels suitable for spawning. Several deep pools potentialy suitable for overwintering westslope cutthroat trout were also observed in this section. Two steps 30cm high and 80cmhigh were observed in channel due to small woody debris accumulation. Habitat value was rated as `r my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% pull(hab_value)` overall. 


## Stream Characteristics Upstream of `r as.character(my_site2)`

The stream was surveyed upstream from `r as.character(my_site2)` for `r my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us') %>% pull(survey_length_m)`m to the base of a waterfall >30m high `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197787-09) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197787-10))")} else(knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197787-d02) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197787-d03))"))`. Within the area surveyed, total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info2(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us') %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(v)` with  `r my_habitat_info2(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us') %>% filter(v == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` dominant. Cover was also present as `r my_habitat_info2(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us') %>% filter(v == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` (Table \@ref(tab:tab-habitat-summary-197787)). The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info3(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us', row = 'avg channel width m')`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info3(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us', row = 'avg wetted width m')`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info3(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us', row = 'average gradient percent')`%.  
Low gradient riffle-pool habitat containing abundant gravels suitable for resident westslope cutthrout trout spawning was present throughout the first approximate 300m of stream surveyed before gradients increased to 6-7% near the top of site. Shallow pools were present intermittently in the area surveyed, created by large woody debris. Habitat value was rated as `r my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us') %>% pull(hab_value)` value with moderate potential for salmonid spawning/rearing.

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {-}

Structure replacement with a bridge (`r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m span) was recommended to provide access to the stream and lake habitat located upstream of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)`. The cost of the work was estimated at \$`r format(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_est_1000s) * 1000, big.mark = ',')` for a cost benefit of `r as.character(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_net))` linear m/\$1000 and `r as.character(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_area_net))`m^2^/\$1000.

## Conclusion {-}

There is `r my_priority_info() %>% pull(upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of habitat upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` to PSCIS crossing `as.character(my_site2)`.  Habitat in the area was surveyed was rated as `r my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us') %>% pull(hab_value)` value for salmonid rearing/spawning primarily due to the presence of the 2ha of rearing habitat in Lodgepole Lake.  The beaver dam upstream of the crossing may provide an obstacle to upstream passage for some migrating fish at some flows however they are not considered permanent, are likely important for maintaining water elevations in the lake and may be passable at some flows.  There is `r my_priority_info(sit = my_site2) %>% pull(upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of habitat upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` before the impassable waterfall with habitat value rated as `r my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us') %>% pull(hab_value)`.  Both crossings are on the `r my_overview_info(site = my_site2) %>% pull(road_name)` under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development District Manager for the Rocky Mountain Forest District.  Due to it's status as a "potential" barrier to upstream migration, crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a `r my_priority_info() %>% pull(priority)` priority for proceeding to design for replacement. Crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` was ranked as a `r my_priority_info(sit = my_site2) %>% pull(priority)` priority for proceeding to design for replacement due to the streams seasonal disconnection from Lodgepole Lake and the relatively short section of habitat available upstream before the falls.

## Site Location {-}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on a `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_name)` 26km south Fernie on `r my_overview_info() %>% pull(road_name)`.  The crossing is located approximately 100m up from the junction of the Lodgepole FSR and the Wigwam FSR. The culverts are located approximately 2.3km upstream from the confluence with Lodgepole Creek. `r my_overview_info() %>% pull(road_name)` (forest file ID 5466) is the responsibility of Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development - Rocky Mountain Forest District.


<br>

## Background {-}


At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_name)` is a `r my_bcfishpass() %>% pull(stream_order) %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately `r fpr_wshd_par()`km^2^. The elevation of the south-west facing watershed ranges from a maximum of `r fpr_wshd_par(col = 'elev_max')`m to `r fpr_wshd_par(col = 'elev_min')`m near the crossing (Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-197793)). Upstream of `r my_overview_info() %>% pull(road_name)`, no fish have previously been recorded [@moe2020KnownBC]. A Fortis gas pipeline compression station is located approximately 600m north of the crossing adjacent to the Lodgepole FSR.

```

<br>

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was earmarked for assessment by Canadian Wildlife Federation due to `bsfishpass` modelling which indicated potentially large quantities of habitat suitable for westslope cutthrout trout spawning and rearing upstream. Table \@ref(tab:tab-bcfp-197793) `r text_ref_tab_summary_bcfp()` A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment [`r my_bcfishpass() %>% pull(dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r my_mapsheet()`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {-}

At the time of the survey, the two culverts under `r my_overview_info() %>% pull(road_name)` were un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment]. The pipes were `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(diameter_or_span_meters)`m in diameter with lengths of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(length_or_width_meters)`m, a culvert slope of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(culvert_slope_percent)`%, a stream width ratio of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_width_ratio)` and an outlet drop of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(outlet_drop_meters)`m (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-197793)). Significant damage to the crossing was apparent with the pipe split vertically through the entire culvert near the centre of the southern most pipe `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197793-01))")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197793-d01))"))`. The stream was completely dry at the time of the survey and the freshwater atlas stream layer indicates intermittent flow [@flnrord2021FreshwaterAtlasb].  Of note, the culverts are located approximately 840m upstream from the confluence with a tributary to Bean Creek and a bridge of stream of the confluence (PSCIS 197792) was assessed on this tributary.  The tributary was flowing at the bridge site at the time of the survey (`r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(date)`).

```{r eval=F}
##this is useful to get some comments for the report
hab_site %>% filter(site == my_site & location == 'us') %>% pull(comments)
my_priority <-  my_priority_info()

```

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {-}

The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for `r my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') %>% pull(survey_length_m)`m `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197793-02))")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197793-d01))"))`. Total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'ds') %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(v)` with  `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'ds') %>% filter(v == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` dominant. Cover was also present as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'ds') %>% filter(v == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` (Table \@ref(tab:tab-habitat-summary-197793)). The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = 'avg channel width m')`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = 'average gradient percent')`%. The dominant substrate was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = "bed material dominant")` with `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = "bed material subdominant")` subdominant. Although, dry at the time of the survey, there were pockets of gravels suitable for resident salmonids and there was evidence of high flows, significant erosion and a deeply incised channel and eroding banks. The habitat was rated as `r my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') %>%  pull(hab_value)` value for resident salmonid rearing due to a lack of water. 

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {-}

The stream was surveyed immediately upstream from `r as.character(my_site)` for approximately `r my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% pull(survey_length_m)`m to a bridge (PSCIS 197794) on the Fortis gas pipline  `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197793-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197793-04))")} else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197793-d2))"))`. Within the area surveyed, total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us') %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(v)` with  `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us') %>% filter(v == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` dominant. Cover was also present as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us') %>% filter(v == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` (Table \@ref(tab:tab-habitat-summary-197793)). The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = 'avg channel width m')`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = 'avg wetted width m')`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = 'average gradient percent')`%.  The dominant substrate was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = "bed material dominant")` with `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = "bed material subdominant")` subdominant. Extensive areas of gravels suitable for spawning resident salmonids were present and there was evidence of high flows, significant erosion and a deeply incised channel and eroding banks. Habitat value was rated as `r my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% pull(hab_value)` value resident salmonid rearing and spawning. 

<br>



## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {-}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed at the site, replacement of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge (`r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at \$`r format(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_est_1000s) * 1000, big.mark = ',')` for a cost benefit of `r as.character(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_net))` linear m/\$1000 and `r as.character(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_area_net))`m^2^/\$1000.


<br>


## Conclusion {-}

A conservative estimate of mainstem habitat upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is `r my_priority_info() %>% pull(upstream_habitat_length_km)`km. Habitat in the areas surveyed upstream of the culvert were rated as `r my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us') %>% pull(hab_value)` value for salmonid rearing and spawning due to likely annual seasonal dewatering within the rocky south-west facing watershed.   `r my_overview_info() %>% pull(road_name)` is the responsibility of the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development - Rocky Mountain Forest District.  Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a `r my_priority_info() %>% pull(priority)` priority for proceeding to design for replacement.

## Site Location {-}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on a `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_name)` 30km south-east Fernie on an unnamed spur road.  The site was located within the Wigwam Flats - Mt. Broadwood/Sportsmans Ridge access management area with a locked gate to prevent entry by motorized vehicles [@geobc2021MapWigwam].  The access gate is located crossing is located approximately 3km up from the junction of the Lodgepole FSR and the Wigwam FSR. The culvert was located `r round(my_bcfishpass() %>% pull(downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream from the confluence with Lodgepole Creek.
