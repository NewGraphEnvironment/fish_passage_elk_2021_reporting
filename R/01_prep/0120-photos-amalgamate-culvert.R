##get list of files (site_ids) in the photo folder
site_id_list <- list.files(path = paste0(getwd(), '/data/photos/'), full.names = T) %>%

##we had a couple of extra litte files in the folder that were a problem. make sure the file is only photo folders

photo_names <- site_id_list %>%

##if the above df build throws a list column warning then there are duplicates.  Deal with those first (should build a filter next time)
## and then run the filter below to find the sites with missing photos
colnms <- names(photo_names)

photo_missing <- photo_names %>%
  filter(across(all_of(colnms), is.na))  ##filter_at(vars(all_of(colnms)), any_vars(is.na(.)))


# So - fpr_photo_qa will only give us site_ids when at least 1 of the photos we search for are there!
# we are missing folders here because we have some dam sites that do not have
#  for this reason we pull our list of files to do the photo amalgamation on from photo_names dataframe above


##once you review the test results and make sure they are all there you are good then run your function over the list
## test on a small sample
# test <- photo_names$site_id %>% head()


test %>%
  map(fpr_photo_amalg_cv)

## make the amalgamated photos for each of the crossings
photo_names$site_id %>%
  map(fpr_photo_amalg_cv)
