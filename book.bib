Catches of juvenile coho were much much lower in the main river than in the ponds where they were the main species, and were more variable in the river. Population density and biomass estimates of juvenile coho in the ponds ranged from 0.100 fish.m-2 and 1.00 g.m-2 to 1.00 fish.m-2 and 5.15 g.m-2, compared with density estimates of 0.08-0.23 fish.m-2 in the river. The coho population in the ponds consisted of 0+ and 1+ age-groups in similar proportions; in the main river the 0+ age-group was much more abundant. Growth rate of coho in the ponds was faster than in the main river, with pond fish reaching mean lengths of 62-79 mm at the end of the 1st growing season, compared with 53 mm in the main river. Smolt outmigration from the main study pond occurred in late spring with peak outmigration in May and June coinciding with peak river discharge and increasing water temperatures in the main river and pond. -from Authors},
