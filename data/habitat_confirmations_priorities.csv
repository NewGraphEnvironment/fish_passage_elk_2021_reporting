8,Dry Creek,62182_ds,500,,,,high,high,"Frequent pools and undercut banks, especially further downstream. Substrate in among trees higher up than normal suggesting high flows and channel movement. Lots of fine sediment settled in pools and on substrate. ",,,,

11,Unnamed Tributary to Lodgepole Creek,197796_us,110,,,,low,low,2.3m high rock falls at ~60m upstream is permanent barrier to upstream migration. ,60,,,
12,Unnamed Tributary to Lodgepole Creek,197796_ds,125,,,,low,low,Bedrock dominated stream with steps to 1.8m high throughout. Gradient downstream near 15%. ,,,,
13,Fuel Creek,50061_ds,210,,,,medium,moderate,Significant channel size change. Survey ended at confluence with Harvey Creek. Surveyed channel was dry but re-waters ~5m from confluence. Potential for moderate to high habitat value when flowing.,,,,
14,Fuel Creek,50061_us,620,,,,medium,moderate,Signs of extremely high flows with large islands and dry side channels. First 200m were dry. Old road sluffing at times and for ~50m was right beside creek eliminating riparian veg.,2000,,,
15,Morris Creek,62122_us,735,,,,medium,moderate,"Good flow, frequent pockets of gravels present suitable for westslope cutthroat trout spawning.  Unlicensed dam located upstream of road ~100m. Main flow of stream is north fork with small amount of flow from southern forks.",3000,,,
16,Morris Creek,62122_ds,550,,,,medium,moderate,Good flow and abundant undercut banks and some small pools available for cover.  Several bridges over stream related to hunting camp located on the stream.  Small falls (0.9m high) located approximately 400m downstream of crossing with steep gradients (19%) for approximately 30m just downstream and before entering Flathead River floodplain. ,,,,
17,Unnamed Tributary to Bighorn Creek,197844_us,840,,,,medium,moderate,Sections getting steep (up to 12.5%) with periodic deep pools under embedded / functional large woody debris. Likely barrier ( 1.1m high rock) located at top of area surveyed 840m upstream of the FSR. Frequent cascading into pools. Confined at times.,3000,,,
18,Unnamed Tributary to Bighorn Creek,197844_ds,95,,,,medium,moderate,"Somewhat steep, mostly dry and appears to be evidence of high velocity and volumes of flow. Stream goes subsurface at 40m downstream then re-waters at 80m downstream.",,,,
19,Parker Creek,50067_us,1200,,,,high,high,Parker creek remnant channel. Appears very similar to upstream size and depth with no water. Channel relocation related to Flathead FSR. Several very large volume beaver controlled wetland areas at downstream end of site would likely hold water if channel and road are relocated.  Aerial survey conducted. Needs to be fixed in conjunction with mocelled crossing 4606967 upstream (currently no structure there).,6000,,,
20,Parker Creek,50067_ds,125,,,,high,high,"Immediately downstream of culvert for approximately 90m is very little water, floodplain area with no vegetation, muddy substrates and active dredging apparent.  The primarily dry channel met with the redirected Parker Creek (or potentially a side channel of the Flathead River) ~ 100m downstream of the FSR.  ",,,,
21,Parker Creek,4606967_ds,670,,,,high,high,"Survey is of old downstream channel that is currently dry, close to redirected upstream channel. Large and easy to find, very similar channel to upstream.  2-5cm of organic litter on top of old channel and can often feel old substrate with poles. ",,,,
22,Parker Creek,4606967_us,590,,,,high,high,"Survey ended at a lake which is partially created by a old beaver bam (1.3 tall in middle, 0.9m tall on edges). Surveyed area included a series of beaver dams with low gradients and deep water. Stream maps as crossing the road but is actually deflected back into what maps as Flathead side channel.  Heavy machine work evident at road to control washouts from remnant channel trajectory.  Great opportunity for restoration.",4000,,,
23,Unnamed Tributary to Lizard Creek,62505_us,700,,,,medium,moderate,Occasional pools present suitable for juvenile westslope cutthroat trout overwintering. Frequent pockets of gravel present suitable for spawning. Good flow. Fairly steep and small system with intermittent small woody debris / root drops between 0.5 and 1m.,680,,,

25,Unnamed Tributary to Lizard Creek,197863_us,100,,,,medium,low,20% gradient immediately upstream of culvert for approximately 40m. Steep system with numerous steps / drops from 0.5 to 1m high. 50m upstream of culvert stream becomes much smaller with less flow. Pockets of gravel are present and there is some rearing habitat.,30,,,
26,Coal Creek,61504_us,520,,,,high,high,"Issue is not structure but debris in channel producing small drop/cascade from 20 - 60cmin height. Some deep pools up to ~1.8m available for overwintering westslope cutthroat trout adults. Some pockets for spawning, large system with low gradient. Mature ACT riparian area with intermittent large woody debris structures throughout. ",14500,,,need to revisit this
