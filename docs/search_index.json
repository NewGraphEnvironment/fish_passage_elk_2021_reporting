"],["intro.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction Nupqu Limited Partnership was retained by the Canadian Wildlife Federation in the fall of 2020 to plan and conduct fish passage and habitat confirmation assessments at road-stream crossings as part of connectivity restoration planning targeting westslope cutthrout trout within the Elk River watershed group. New Graph Environment Ltd. was sub-contracted by Nupqu Limited Partnership to assist with project delivery. The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat (Bramblett et al. 2002; Swales and Levings 1989; Diebel et al. 2015). Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to low water depth, increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues (Slaney, Zaldokas, and Watershed Restoration Program (B.C.) 1997; Cote et al. 2005). As road crossing structures are commonly upgraded or removed there are numerous opportunities to restore connectivity by ensuring that fish passage considerations are incorporated into repair, replacement, relocation and deactivation designs. "],["background.html", "2 Background 2.1 Project Location 2.2 Fisheries", " 2 Background As a result of high-level direction from the provincial government, a Fish Passage Strategic Approach protocol has been developed for British Columbia to ensure that the greatest opportunities for restoration of fish passage are pursued. A Fish Passage Technical Working Group has been formed to coordinate the protocol and data is continuously amalgamated within the Provincial Steam Crossing Inventory System (PSCIS). The strategic approach protocol involves a four-phase process as described in Fish Passage Technical Working Group (2014) : Phase 1: Fish Passage Assessment  Fish stream crossings within watersheds with high fish values are assessed to determine barrier status of structures and document a general assessment of adjacent habitat quality and quantity. Phase 2: Habitat Confirmation  Assessments of crossings prioritized for follow up in Phase 1 studies are conducted to confirm quality and quantity of habitat upstream and down as well as to scope for other potential nearby barriers that could affect the practicality of remediation. Phase 3: Design  Site plans and designs are drawn for priority crossings where high value fish habitat has been confirmed. Phase 4: Remediation  Reconnection of isolated habitats through replacement, rehabilitation or removal of prioritized crossing structure barriers. The Canadian Wildlife Federation has been working on a watershed connectivity remediation plan for the Elk River watershed that incorporates the provincial Strategic Approach and local knowledge of the watershed to prioritize barriers for remediation, to restore connectivity for westslope cutthroat trout and other species in a strategic manner. Nupqu Limited Partnership was retained to conduct fish passage assessments and habitat confirmations to fill data gaps in support of this work. 2.1 Project Location To focus the project within habitat considered high value for conservation of westslope cutthrout trout, the study area included the upper Elk River watershed upstream of the Kookanusa Reservoir (Figure 2.1). The Elk River has a mean annual discharge of 26 m3/s at station 08NK016 near Sparwood and 47.3 m3/s at station 08NK016 near Fernie with flow patterns typical of high elevation watersheds on the west side of the Rocky Mountains which receive large amounts of precipitation as snow leading to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July (Figures 2.2 - 2.4) (Environment and Canada 2020).

When Europeans settled in the Kootenay Region around 200 hundred years ago, the Indian Reserves were created which lead to the seven Indian Bands: akisqnuk- Columbia Lake Band (Windermere, BC); aqam- St. Marys Band (Cranbrook, BC); akinkumasnuqiit- Tobacco Plains Band (Grasmere, BC); yaqan nukiy- Lower Kootenay Band (Creston, BC); kyaknuqiit- Shuswap Band (Invermere, BC); aqanqmi- Kootenai Tribe of Idaho (Bonners Ferry, Idaho); kupawi¢qnuk- Ksanka Band (Elmo, Montana) Ktunaxa Nation (2020) report the vision statement of the Ktunaxa as: Kmakqa ksukua·k kukqani  kitqaki haqa ksi xa a·kukqais ksukiqukami·k kiin Ktunaxa nas amakis. Qus pikaks nas xa yaqanaki haqaki. Kitqawimu kakiwiki amakis kisnikik kxa qa kikkaxuxami·k kitqaki haqa  kisin aknumutiis. The vision statement has been translated to english as: Strong, healthy citizens and communities, speaking our languages and celebrating who we are and our history in our ancestral homelands, working together, managing our lands and resources, within a self-sufficient, self-governing Nation. 2.1.2 Elk Valley Cumulative Effects Management Framework First Nations, stakeholders, proponents and provincial and municipal governments have recognized that the region has been impacted by historic and current coal operations as well as other stresses such as forestry operations, wildfire, residential development, recreational activities and transportation. To assess the historic, current and potential future conditions of valued ecosystem components and to support resource management decisions within the region, the Provincial Cumulative Effects Framework and the Elk Valley Cumulative Effects Management Framework (EV-CEMF) have been formed under joint management between the Ktunaxa Nation Council and the B.C. Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development (FLNRORD). A working group consisting of the Ktunaxa Nation Council, industry, community, organizations, and provincial government ministries has been formed to provide guidance and oversight for EV-CEMF activities. Valued component technical reports for Grizzly Bear, Riparian and westslope cutthroat trout (Davidson et al. 2018), bighorn sheep, and old and mature forest have been drafted, integrated into an overarching Cumulative Effects Assessment and Management Report (Elk Valley Cumulative Effects Management Framework Working Group 2018) and endorsed by the Working Group. These reports describe the historical, current, and future assessment of cumulative effects in the Elk Valley and provide management and mitigation recommendations. Next steps for the framework include the development of an Implementation Plan to identify priority actions and spatial locations to focus management and mitigation of cumulative effects in the valley which may include actions to address aquatic habitat connectivity issues (Ministry of Forests 2020). 2.2 Fisheries Fish species recorded in the Elk River watershed group are detailed in Table 2.1 (MoE 2020a). Bull trout and westslope cutthrout trout are considered of special concern (blue-listed) provincially and westslope cutthrout trout (Pacific populations) are are listed under the Species at Risk Act by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada as a species of special concern (BC Species &amp; Ecosystem Explorer 2020b, 2020a; Schweigert et al. 2017). The focus of 2020 field work was to assess potential impacts of road-stream crossings on habitat connectivity for westslope cutthrout trout.

All have habitat requirements during life history stages that include cold clean water and varied forms of cover (undercut banks, pool-riffle habitat and riparian vegetation). Stream-resident fish inhabitat headwater streams above barriers, complete their life cycle within a relatively small range and typically remain relatively small (i.e. &lt;200mm in length). Fluvial fish are migratory subpopulations that migrate between small spawning/rearing tributaries and larger adult rearing rivers. Lengths of fluvial fish generally reach more than 400mm. Finally, adfluvial subpopulations rear in lakes and migrate to spawning/rearing tributaries with lengths often exceeding 500mm (Schweigert et al. 2017). Spawning habitat for resident and fluvial subpopulations are documented as within the tailouts of deep pools at moderate to high-flow events within small, low-gradient streams with cold well-oxygenated water and clean unsilted gravels (Schmetterling 2001). Proximity to large woody debris, boulder or bedrock cover is important for spawning fish while residing in spawning tributaries as high mortality may result when suitable cover is lacking. The dominant substrate used for spawning is gravel (1.8 - 3.3cm diameter) with spawning occurring in late May and June towards the end of the spring freshet with rising water temperatures between 7-11\\(^\\circ\\)C. Nine of 11 westslope cutthrout trout radio-tagged in the Blackfoot River drainage, Montana by Schmetterling (2001) made movements to tributaries presumable for spawning. While in tributaries, fish movements to spawning sites averaged 12.5km where they stayed within an approximately 100m reach during the spawning period for between 15 and 63 days. Small perennial streams with a diversity of cover are important for juvenile rearing with young-of-year fish inhabiting low energy lateral habitats (i.e. shallow riffle or backwatered areas) with cover available. Larger juveniles move into pools with social dominance behaviors prevalent and based on fish size. Availability of pool habitat is important and limiting for parr which have large territories (Schweigert et al. 2017; Schmetterling 2001). The suitability of overwintering habitat is determined by groundwater influx and the absence of anchor ice with fluvial adults congregating in slow deep pools in the winter. Boulders and other large in-stream structures or off-channel habitat (beaver bonds and sloughs) provide cover for juveniles with adfluvial fish overwintering in lakes (Schweigert et al. 2017; Brown and Mackay 1995; Cope, Schwarz, and Prince 2017). In a swimming performance study conducted in an open-channel flume Blank et al. (2020) estimated the overall average swim speeds of westlope cutthrout trout (150mm - 290mm in length) at 0.84m/s with a maximum observed swim speed of 3.55m/s. The greatest threats to westslope cutthrout trout are hybridization with non-native rainbow trout and degradation of the environment due to forestry, hydroelectric development, mining, urbanization and agriculture (Schweigert et al. 2017). Lamson (2020) sampled over 2000 trout in the Upper Kootenay watershed from 2014 to 2019 with results of genotyping indicating consistently high levels of westslope cutthrout trout allele purity (i.e. very low levels of rainbow trout, yellowstone cutthrout trout or coastal cutthrout trout genetic introgression) throughout the Elk River watershed areas upstream of the Elko Dam. Boyer, Muhlfeld, and Allendorf (2008) sampled 31 sites in the upper Flathead River system within the United States (27 sites) and Canada (4 sites). Genetic introgression declined with latitude with no evidence of rainbow trout allelles within any westslope cutthrout trout sampled within the Canadian portion of the upper Flathead River. A summary of historical westslope cutthrout trout observations in the Elk River watershed group by average gradient category of associated stream segment is provided in Figure 2.5. Of 4003 observations, 93% were within stream segments with average gradients ranging from 0 - 8%. A total of 73% of historic observations were within stream segments with gradients between 0 - 3%, 12% were within stream segments with gradients ranging from 3 - 5% and 8% were within stream segments with gradients between 5 - 8% (MoE 2020a; Norris 2020).

"],["methods.html", "3 Methods 3.1 Planning 3.2 Fish Passage Assessments 3.3 Habitat Confirmation Assessments 3.4 Reporting 3.5 Mapping", " 3 Methods Workflows for the project have been classified into planning, fish passage assessments, habitat confirmation assessments, reporting and mapping. All components leveraged R, SQL or Python programming languages to facilitate workflow tracking, collaboration, transparency and continually improving research. Project workflows utilized local and remote postgreSQL databases as well as a snapshot of select datasets contained within a local sqlite database. A data and script repository to facilitate this reporting is located on Github. 3.1 Planning Priorities for site assessment locations were provided by Canadian Wildlife Federation with some additional sites selected by field crews based on background literature, fisheries information, PSCIS, bcfishpass (Norris [2020] 2021) outputs and field reconnaissance. bcfishpass is an open-source code repository that models aquatic connectivity based on a suite of hard coded (maximum stream slope downstream, PSCIS barrier information, dam locations and user defined parameters (gradient/width/discharge). Details of the general methodology can be found here and may be updated over time as the tool evolves. Once a development environment is properly setup, the software builds a local postgresql database through the utilization of other open-source tools such as bcdata (Norris [2016] 2021), bcfishobs (Norris [2018] 2021), and fwapg (Norris [2019] 2021) to provide connectivity models developed from analysis of the BC Freshwater Atlas, road layers, fisheries information, Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium stream discharge data, measured and modeled estimates of channel width and numerous other standardized datasets downloaded directly from the BC Data Catalogue application programming interface using bcdata. 3.1.1 Accessible Habitat bcfishpass calculates the average gradient of BC Freshwater Atlas stream network lines at minimum 100m long intervals starting from the downstream end of the streamline segment and working upstream. The network lines are broken into max gradient categories with new segments created if and when the average slope of the stream line segment exceeds user provided thresholds. For this project, the user provided gradient thresholds used to delineate potentially accessible habitat were based on estimated max gradients that westslope cutthrout trout (22%) are likely to be capable of ascending. bcfishpass identifes natural barriers (ex. steep gradients for extended distances) and hydroelectric dams to classifying the accessibility upstream by fish (Norris [2020] 2021). On potentially accessible streams, scripts identify known barriers (ex. waterfalls &gt;5m high) and additional anthropogenic features which are primarily road/railway stream crossings (i.e. culverts) that are potentially barriers. To prioritize these features for assessment or remediation, scripts report on how much modelled potentially accessible aquatic habitat the barriers may obstruct. The model can be refined with known fish observations upstream of identified barriers and for each crossing location, the area of lake and wetland habitat upstream, species documented upstream/downstream, an estimate of watershed area (on 2nd order and higher streams), estimates of discharge, mean annual precipitation weighted to upstream watershed area and channel width. This, information, can be used to provides an indication of the potential quantity and quality of habitat potentially gained should fish passage be restored by comparing to user defined thresholds for the aforementioned parameters. bcfishpass and associated tools have been designed to be flexible in analysis, accepting user defined gradient, channel width and stream discharge categories (MoE 2020c). Although currently in draft form, and subject to development revisions, Canadian Wildlife Federation assigned gradient and discharge thresholds for habitat with the highest intrinsic value for westslope cutthrout trout have been estimated and applied to model habitat upstream of stream crossing locations (Table 3.1). Thresholds were derived based on a literature review with references provided in Table 3.2.

(2013) and Grainger (2011). To determine which of those crossings had not yet been assessed with Phase 1 and Phase 2 assessments we cross-referenced these reports with the Phase 2 report previously completed in the study area (Masse Environmental Consultants Ltd. 2015; Vast Resource Solutions Inc. 2013) and reviewed outputs from PSCIS as well as bcfishpass. Outputs for modeled and PSCIS crossings (barriers and potential barriers) that met the following criteria underwent a detailed review to facilitate prioritization for Phase1 - Fish Passage Assessments and Phase 2 - Habitat Confirmations. Confirmed fish presence upstream of the PSCIS or modelled structure. Stream width documented as &gt; 2.0m in PSCIS. Habitat value rated as medium or high in PSCIS. For PSCIS crossings: linear lengths of modelled upstream habitat &lt;22% gradient for 1km For modelled crossings crossings: linear lengths of modelled upstream habitat &lt;22% gradient for 2km and no anthropogenic barriers (including modelled potential stream crossing structures) documented downstream. Crossings located on streams classified as 3rd order or higher. 3.2 Fish Passage Assessments In the field, crossings prioritized for follow-up were first assessed for fish passage following the procedures outlined in Field Assessment for Determining Fish Passage Status of Closed Bottomed Structures (MoE 2011). Crossings surveyed included closed bottom structures (CBS), open bottom structures (OBS) and crossings considered other (i.e. fords). Photos were taken at surveyed crossings and when possible included images of the road, crossing inlet, crossing outlet, crossing barrel, channel downstream and channel upstream of the crossing and any other relevant features. The following information was recorded for all surveyed crossings: date of inspection, crossing reference, crew member initials, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, stream name, road name and kilometer, road tenure information, crossing type, crossing subtype, culvert diameter or span for OBS, culvert length or width for OBS. A more detailed full assessment was completed for all closed bottom structures and included the following parameters: presence/absence of continuous culvert embedment (yes/no), average depth of embedment, whether or not the culvert bed resembled the native stream bed, presence of and percentage backwatering, fill depth, outlet drop, outlet pool depth, inlet drop, culvert slope, average downstream channel width, stream slope, presence/absence of beaver activity, presence/absence of fish at time of survey, type of valley fill, and a habitat value rating. Habitat value ratings were based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), fish migration patterns, the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation (Table 3.3). For crossings determined to be potential barriers or barriers based on the data (see Barrier Scoring), a culvert fix and recommended diameter/span was proposed. Table 3.3: Habitat value criteria (Fish Passage Technical Working Group, 2011). Habitat Value Fish Habitat Criteria High The presence of high value spawning or rearing habitat (e.g., locations with abundance of suitably sized gravels, deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris) which are critical to the fish population. Medium Important migration corridor. Presence of suitable spawning habitat. Habitat with moderate rearing potential for the fish species present. Low No suitable spawning habitat, and habitat with low rearing potential (e.g., locations without deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris, and with little or no suitably sized spawning gravels for the fish species present). 3.2.1 Barrier Scoring Fish passage potential was determined for each stream crossing identified as a closed bottom structure as per MoE (2011). The combined scores from five criteria: depth and degree to which the structure is embedded, outlet drop, stream width ratio, culvert slope, and culvert length were used to screen whether each culvert was a likely barrier to some fish species and life stages (Table 3.4, Table 3.5. These criteria were developed based on data obtained from various studies and reflect an estimation for the passage of a juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout (Clarkin et al. 2005 ; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013). Table 3.4: Fish Barrier Risk Assessment (MoE 2011). Risk LOW MOD HIGH Embedded &gt;30cm or &gt;20% of diameter and continuous &lt;30cm or 20% of diameter but continuous No embedment or discontinuous Value 0 5 10 Outlet Drop (cm) &lt;15 15-30 &gt;30 Value 0 5 10 SWR &lt;1.0 1.0-1.3 &gt;1.3 Value 0 3 6 Slope (%) &lt;1 1-3 &gt;3 Value 0 5 10 Length (m) &lt;15 15-30 &gt;30 Value 0 3 6 Table 3.5: Fish Barrier Scoring Results (MoE 2011). Cumlative Score Result 0-14 passable 15-19 potential barrier &gt;20 barrier 3.2.2 Cost Benefit Analysis A cost benefit analysis was conducted for each crossing determined to be a barrier based on an estimate of cost associated with remediation or replacement of the crossing with a structure that facilitates fish passage and the amount of potential habitat that would be made available by remediation of fish passage at the site (habitat gain index). 3.2.2.1 Habitat Gain Index The habitat gain index is the quantity of modeled habitat upstream of the subject crossing and represents an estimate of habitat gained with remediation of fish passage at the crossing. For this project, a gradient threshold between accessible and non-accessible habitat was set at 22% (for a minimimum length of 100m) intended to represent the maximum gradient of which the strongest swimmers of westslope cutthrout trout are likely to be able to migrate upstream. For reporting of Phase 1 - fish passage assessments within the body of this report (Table 3.4), a total value of habitat &lt;22% output from bcfishpass was used to estimate the amount of habitat upstream of each crossing less than 22% gradient before a falls of height &gt;5m - as recorded in MoE (2020b) or documented in other bcfishpass online documentation. To generate areas of habitat upstream, the estimated linear length was multiplied by the downstream channel width measured as part of the fish passage assessment protocol. Although these estimates are not generally conservative, have low accuracy and do not account for upstream stream crossing structures they do allow a rough screening of the best candidates for follow up with more detailed Phase 2 assessments. For Phase 2 - habitat confirmation sites, conservative estimates of the linear quantity of habitat to be potentially gained by fish passage restoration, mainstem and large tributary streams (&gt;1st order streams) segments upstream of each crossing that were &lt;22%, below natural barriers and downstream of documented culvert barriers were measured by hand with the measure tool within QGIS (QGIS Development Team 2009). To generate estimates of the area of habitat upstream of these sites, the length of habitat was multiplied by the upstream average channel width that was measured in the field. Potential options to remediate fish passage were selected from MoE (2011) and included: Removal (RM) - Complete removal of the structure and deactivation of the road. Open Bottom Structure (OBS) - Replacement of the culvert with a bridge or other open bottom structure. For this project we considered bridges as the only viable option for OBS type based on consultation with FLNR road crossing engineering experts. It should be noted however, that box culverts could be considered a viable and economical option as they have been observed as successfully facilitating fish passage on the west coast of the province (Betty Rebellato, Canadian Wildlife Federation - Project Biologist). Streambed Simulation (SS) - Replacement of the structure with a streambed simulation design culvert. Often achieved by embedding the culvert by 40% or more. Based on consultation with FLNR engineering experts, we considered crossings on streams with a channel width of &lt;2m and a stream gradient of &lt;8% as candidates for replacement with streambed simulations. Additional Substrate Material (EM) - Add additional substrate to the culvert and/or downstream weir to embed culvert and reduce overall velocity/turbulence. This option was considered only when outlet drop = 0, culvert slope &lt;1.0% and stream width ratio &lt; 1.0. Backwater (BW) - Backwatering of the structure to reduce velocity and turbulence. This option was considered only when outlet drop &lt; 0.3m, culvert slope &lt;2.0%, stream width ratio &lt; 1.2 and stream profiling indicates it would be effective.. Cost estimates for structure replacement with bridges and embedded culverts were generated based on the channel width, slope of the culvert, depth of fill, road class and road surface type. Road details were sourced from FLNRORD (2020b) and FLNRORD (2020a) through bcfishpass. Interviews with Phil MacDonald, Engineering Specialist FLNR - Kootenay, Steve Page, Area Engineer - FLNR - Northern Engineering Group and Matt Hawkins - MoTi - Design Supervisor for Highway Design and Survey - Nelson, David Maloney - FLNR - Fish Passage Technical Working Group were utilized to help refine estimates. Base costs for installation of bridges on forest service roads and permit roads with surfaces specified in provincial GIS road layers as rough and loose was estimated at $17,500/linear m and assumed that the road could be closed during construction and a minimum bridge span of 10m. For streams with channel widths &lt;2m, embedded culverts were reported as an effective solution with total installation costs estimated at $25k/crossing (pers. comm. Phil MacDonald, Steve Page). For larger streams (&gt;6m), span width increased proportionally to the size of the stream (ex. for an 8m wide stream a 12m wide span was prescribed). For crossings with large amounts of fill (&gt;3m), the replacement bridge span was increased by an additional 3m for each 1m of fill &gt;3m to account for cutslopes to the stream at a 1.5:1 ratio. To account for road type, a multiplier table was also generated to estimate incremental cost increases with costs estimated for structure replacement on paved surfaces, railways and arterial/highways costing up to 20 times more than forest service roads due to expenses associate with design/engineering requirements, traffic control and paving. The cost multiplier table (Table 3.6) should be considered very approximate with refinement recommended for future projects. Table 3.6: Cost multiplier table based on road class and surface type.

The main objective of the field surveys was to document upstream habitat quantity and quality and to determine if any other obstructions exist above or below the crossing. Habitat value was assessed based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation. Criteria used to rank habitat value was based on guidelines in Fish Passage Technical Working Group (2011) (Table 3.3). During habitat confirmations, to standardize data collected and facilitate submission of the data to provincial databases, information was collated on Site Cards. Habitat characteristics recorded included channel widths, wetted widths, residual pool depths, gradients, bankfull depths, stage, temperature, conductivity, pH, cover by type, substrate and channel morphology (among others). When possible, the crew surveyed downstream of the crossing to the point where fish presence had been previously confirmed and upstream to a minimum distance of 600m. Any potential obstacles to fish passage were inventoried with photos, physical descriptions and locations recorded on site cards. Surveyed routes were recorded with time-signatures on handheld GPS units. 3.4 Reporting Reporting was generated with bookdown (Xie 2016) from Rmarkdown (Allaire et al. 2021) with primarily R (R Core Team 2020) and SQL scripts. In addition to numerous spatial layers sourced through the BC Data Catalogue then stored and queried in a local postgresql database data inputs for this project include: Populated Fish Data Submission Spreadsheet Template - V 2.0, January 20, 2020 Populated pscis_assessment_template_v24.xls Fish Habitat Model/bcfishpass outputs.

Photos and photo metadata 3.5 Mapping Mapping was completed by Hillcrest Geographics. pdf maps were generated using QGIS with data supplied via a postgreSQL database. A QGIS layer file defining and symbolizing all layers required for general fish passage mapping was developed and at the time of reporting was kept under version control within bcfishpass.

A total of 89 Phase 1 assessments were conducted with 19 crossings considered passable, 1 crossings considered potential barriers and 31 crossings considered barriers according to threshold values based on culvert embedment, outlet drop, slope, diameter (relative to channel size) and length (MoE 2011). Additionally, although all were considered fully passable, 1 crossings assessed were fords with a barrier ranking of unknown. Georeferenced field maps are presented in here and available for bulk download as Attachment 1. A summary of crossings assessed, a cost benefit analysis and priority ranking for follow up for Phase 1 sites presented in Table 4.1. Detailed data with photos are presented in Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos. Barrier and Potential Barrier rankings used in this project followed MoE (2011) and reflect an assessment of passability for juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout at any flows potentially present throughout the year (Clarkin et al. 2005 ; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013). As noted in Bourne et al. (2011), with a detailed review of different criteria in Kemp and OHanley (2010), passability of barriers can be quantified in many different ways. Fish physiology (i.e. species, length, swim speeds) can make defining passability complex but with important implications for evaluating connectivity and prioritizing remediation candidates (Bourne et al. 2011; Shaw et al. 2016; Mahlum et al. 2014; Kemp and OHanley 2010). Washington Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife (2009) present criteria for assigning passability scores to culverts that have already been assessed as barriers in coarser level assessments. These passability scores provide additional information to feed into decision making processes related to the prioritization of remediation site candidates and have potential for application in British Columbia.

A total of approximately 18 km of stream was assessed, fish sampling utilizing electrofishing and/or minnowtrapping was conducted at eight sites, and three sites were mapped using remotely piloted aircraft. Of note, in 2020, surveys in some larger mid Bulkley River tributaries with high potential low gradient habitat gains (ex. Toboggan Creek and John Brown Creek) were not conducted due to poor survey conditions caused by high water. Additionally, assessment at crossings on some large tributary streams in the upper Bulkley River were not conducted due to finite quantities of field time (ex. Ailport Creek, Cesford Creek and Watson Creek). Georeferenced field maps are presented in here and available for bulk download as Attachment 1. As collaborative decision making was ongoing at the time of reporting, site prioritization can be considered preliminary. In total, Five crossings were rated as high priorities for proceeding to design for replacement, 7 crossings were rated as moderate priorities, and 3 crossings were rated as low priorities. Results are summarized in Figure 4.1 and Tables 4.2 - ?? with raw habitat and fish sampling data included in digital format as Attachment 4. A summary of preliminary modelling results illustrating the quantities of westslope cutthrout trout spawning and rearing habitat potentially available upstream of each crossing as estimated by measured/modeled channel width and upstream accessible stream length are presented in Figure 4.2. Detailed information for each site assessed with Phase 2 assessments (including maps) are presented within site specific appendices to this document.

"],["recommendations.html", "5 Recommendations", " 5 Recommendations Although remediation and replacement of stream crossing structures can have benefits to local fish populations (Saldi-Caromile et al. 2004; Roni, Hanson, and Beechie 2008), the costs of remedial works can be significant and the impacts of the work on fisheries communities often complex to evaluate and quantify. The potential cost benefits, ethical dynamics and feasibility of ecosystem restoration funding allocation towards infrastructure upgrades on transportation right of ways should be explored collaboratively alongside the cost benefits, ethical dynamics and feasibility of alternative/additional investment activities such as transportation corridor relocation/deactivation, land procurement/covenant, cattle exclusion, riparian restoration, habitat complexing, water conservation, commercial/recreational fishing management and research.
